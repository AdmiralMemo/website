Lacking the powerful follicle volume of his successors, this Pike variant is an easy catch and release candidate until you’re at cruising altitude in the midgame. Lacking the ability to participate in weekend cadet missions and with subpar collection value, you’ll find his CMD/DIP/SUCK voyage ability unable to stand up to higher rarity options as well.

Green light base and voyage power is tempting for new players, but they’re easily replaceable attributes by your weekly event rewards.
