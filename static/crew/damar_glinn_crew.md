Ol’ Glen Dammers here is so confident in his abilities that he only needs one Trait, and that fills out of his Collection bonus. His SEC score isn’t amazing but it might hit a few Nodes in Missions and Cadets. But his CMD is a let down and with only one Trait and nothing special about his stats he’s not going to be useful Voyaging. Another one hit Collection wonder.
