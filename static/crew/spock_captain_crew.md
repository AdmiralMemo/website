With a Crew this old, you have to hope for two things - Events and Collections, both derived from Traits. Captain Spock has both! Spock Events are eternal, especially with Ethan Peck’s portrayal on a currently-airing show, and Captain Spock’s Trait list gives him options for plenty of bonuses based on those. A trio of Collections plus a few Traits untapped in his uniform pockets give the Captain of the Enterprise plenty of long term value, and if you get a copy early on in your game you might even want to bring him to Gauntlet with a beefy CMD Proficiency to get you a few wins.
