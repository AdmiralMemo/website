Rom was the first Legendary with his Skill set, but now that number has ballooned with the overall crew count. Horrific numbers in every corner of this card (including a 10-26 CMD proficiency), relegate Quark's brother to Collection and buxom Bajoran magnet.

Already with a rock-solid set of Collections, Rom has a higher ceiling here than most and may grow out of his awkward teenage years in the eyes of players if he reaches full potential. If you count an unexpected Event or two per year as a smidge of value, it's easy to make a case for Rom over a few dozen dud Legendaries.
