As Rare Crew with MED go, Phlox is useful, but he only enjoys one day of weekend Cadet Mission eligibility and his Base seems pretty low  when you consider there are two handfuls of crew above him in the rankings. Of course MED/CMD is valuable on Voyages (Phloxâ€™s is Primary and Tertiary) and his power is good enough to give him some staying power until you Fuse up higher Rarity Crew. As Collections go he snags a position in four of them, with an outside possibility of a fifth.
