Dehner Dehner Dehner Dehner Batman! I hate to be negative about such an iconic character, but there's not enough meat here for a compliment sandwich. 

This was a crew we long warned players off of for a lack of both power and utility and just a few years after her release, she's essentially completely dead in the water. She's not a Voyager, a Shuttler, a Gauntleteer, an Event Crew, or a Collection Crew. If the Telekinetic Collection ever hits, we are in trouble.
