Tilly nabs a place in the Timelines history books as the second crew (first Super Rare) to debut through Campaigns. That's a fortuitous landing spot for her, because she lacks all the essential long term attributes for daily use.

The Tilly family's fatal flaw rears its head again - her lack of Traits. Better off than some of her older cousins, SO Tilly at least finds herself with two Collections and one more viable Trait.
