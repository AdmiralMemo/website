Who’s that girl…? Who’s that girl…?! It’s KES!

Nurse Kes is fairly useful in the early game for critting Cadet Mission Nodes, but her place atop the Uncommon Crew Base ranks has been stolen, and by a lot, by Ensign Tendi. MED is still a rare Skill in the early game, so don’t hesitate to Immortalize her and get her +1 in the Prodigy Collection for a global State boost.
