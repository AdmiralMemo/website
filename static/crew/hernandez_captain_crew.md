Here she finally is - the first female Captain in Starfleet, the vaunted commander of the NX-02 Columbia, who climbs mountains in her spare time, and who can even deal with noted bonehead Captain Archer at his most introspective. What has the game got for us? Is she a Gauntlet powerhouse? A collections bonanza, a voyage monster? A new #1 base, perhaps?

Try a non-event two skiller with a primary debuting in the double digits.

If your obscure fetish is two skillers with 'high' voyage metrics (weird flex, but okay), then Erika is the crew for you, but the rest of us are all just sort of staring, wondering what possible use a card like this actually is. Much like the show that birthed it, the Enterprise mega had a few highs, a few bright spots, but ended with a poorly sculpted and disappointing holo-thud - and that thud's name is Captain Erika Hernandez.
