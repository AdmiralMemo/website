Here she finally is - the first female Captain in Starfleet, the vaunted commander of the NX-02 Columbia, who climbs mountains in her spare time, and who can even deal with noted bonehead Captain Archer at his most introspective. What has the game got for us? Is she a Gauntlet powerhouse? A Trait bonanza, a Voyage monster? A new #1 Base, perhaps?

Hernandez’s card is a deserved punchline and one of the first names that come to mind when someone wants an example of an awful crew. Yes, she’s managed to gather a trio of Collections from a thin Trait set, and may gather a fourth, but don’t jump up to take her from a Behold unless she’s the clear favorite (somehow?).
