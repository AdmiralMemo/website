First off, let's all take a moment to appreciate the best Crew name this game has ever produced. Fetishists rejoice for a tier 1 name. Her Bases are an interesting tale - she's the only appreciable Bev SEC with worthwhile MED as well. That hasn't mattered much for years, but a strong 2021-2023 for variant bonuses as well as Trait matches on weekends have given her a place to shine.

Speaking of Collections, Bev is worth the dive for a lot of players. Four inclusions is above average for her Legendary Rarity but sheâ€™s topped out without finding herself in a TNG show Collection one day.
