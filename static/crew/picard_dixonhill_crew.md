What's shakin', Dix? The usual, Nick. Martinis and geriatrics fighting the Borg. Picardâ€™s namesake television show and some eventable traits will trigger bonuses for him, but his terrible bases may not always make the thaw cost worth it. With most of his value stemming from collections, the good detective is a long term project you should feel free to fuse and level at your convenience.
