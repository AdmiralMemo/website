A "new era" Seven has bases to put past variants to shame and with Cheesecake Seven following suit and ST:Picard on the horizon, Seven in Silver is a speculative investment. Variant and/or Borg events *should* pick up in some capacity to provide a more impressive event clip than what she's enjoyed to date. She's not recommended in a non-shuttle capacity, despite various top ten voyage or gauntlet metrics. The lack of a third skill and skill pair concerns hamper her utility for all but the youngest rosters.
