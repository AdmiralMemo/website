Seskulluh (we are workshopping this celebrity power couple name, please be sure to let us know how you feel about it publicly in the Trek Time Discord Server) is the answer to the question no one asked: When are we getting more Kazon crew?!

Notedly NOT a Fusion Crew (don’t try and Fuse Kazon Seska and First Maje Culluh; we’ve tried, it doesn’t work!), but a possible entry in the future Seated Collection (take note, WRG Ben!), this crew enjoys capable enough Voyage power in a plus Skill set and order, debuting in the top five of their triplet and atop their specific order. 

Eclectic Traits only give them a single Collection at unboxing, but possibly five or six more viable ones give them a lot of long term value for those who can stomach looking at a Wish.com Klingon like Culluh in their Crew Quarters. Not a whole lot else here except for the novelty of the dual crew.
