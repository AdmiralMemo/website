Somewhere out there in the future is a DIP/SCI Super Rare that will earn resounding applause, but today is not that day. There are no power notes to support her worn out skill set or depressingly thin trait list, in fact that little Survivalist tag is doing about 90% of the heavy lifting on her value. Unless you can collect several copies of her in short order while your roster is still young, just take your time building her from otherwise poor beholds for some marginal collection and event value down the line.
