Somewhere out there in the future is a DIP/SCI Super Rare that I’ll have high praise for but today is not that day. Karyn sports some average numbers to secure her space on many early game voyages but she lacks a good array for traits to back up her mediocre numbers. She’s replaceable with any number of recent additions and doesn’t have quite enough power to justify her poor event count. However with the right combination she might be able to push a six hour voyage into eight.
