There's some voyage use to be had here, but with a fairly thin traits set and no variants, her mountainous event count may be backwards-looking. Discovery and Hologram have carried dozens of crew to relevance over the last few years, but it's anyone's guess when that may stop. Barring something like a Costumed or Hologram collection, Zora's contribution level to the average roster has been high, but is on shaky ground.
