One of the top choices for DIP crew makes Q a top contender for Sunday cadet missions and node hunting. Might have some tertiary use on Voyages and if you have a ship with the position ability, consider pairing him up with it to increase damage dealt. With the addition of the Q Collection, this Q becomes essential as the only cadet in that collection and makes a strong choice to fill out your DIP crew.
