To use an agriculture analogy, among the Legendary crew available from the Animated Mega Event, this Boimler is all chaff, no wheat. Sure, he has a plus Skill set headlined by an ENG Primary, and sure he has three Collections, with a longshot chance for a fourth, but his Voyage power is on the weak side, and without any ancillary benefits like Gauntlet or Ship Battle utility, you might want to fail to water this one.
