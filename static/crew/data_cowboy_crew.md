Sort of a textbook Behold option in the late game, Frank is generally shunned by the players who would benefit from him the most. Of course his stats aren't great as a 2016 card, but his Skills line up for ideal Shuttle seating and Data's household name brand will never hurt for Event bonuses.

Hollander's delectable Trait set offers him a great Collection ceiling (with a Vanity in tow) and has given his Event history a buffer of regularity that many crew would be jealous of, and his payoff at Immortalization is better than his reputation may suggest.
