You'd think 'The Father of the Transporter' would be a more remarkable crew in Timelines. After all, Commander Trip "Charles" Tucker used to read his biography as a boy.

As he stands, no pun intended, Emory isn't much more than a voyager, albeit a competent one. Traits which are likely dead ends for event bonii are satisfactory for a good hit rate on voyage anti-matter and his overall voyage power is average-to-good for a new release.

Blunted bases aren't a huge concern given his lack of foreseeable event work, but they also don't translate into enough proficiency for much gauntlet play either. Emory will voyage for a couple years on most rosters, but with so few peripheral perks, you'll need to star him up early on to utilize him on voyages while you still can.
