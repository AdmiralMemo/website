Kasidy's value heavily rests on her Saturday Cadet mission eligibility - she has two skills that can make some noise on Epic difficulty, but if youâ€™re willing to level two sets of crew for the weekend, you may as well pick ones with greater utility than what Kasidy offers. This card is an easy airlock for rosters at every level of play.
