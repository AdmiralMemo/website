I can’t even make the “they’re real and they’re spectacular” joke, because why do they have the Hologram trait?? Perhaps primed to drop that value if Tilting Point ever requires the developers to *watch the show*, there are still some points of interest for the Delaney sisters.

DIP/SEC/CMD is an underrepresented skill order in an overrepresented skill set. In combination with a six pack of anti-matter traits, that buys them some level of cachet on voyages, particularly if you’re utilizing a voyage calculator. Their FBB-friendly ship ability is also plenty usable for a crew whose art you absolutely want to be looking at on a daily basis. With a smattering of viable traits and requisite base/voyage power, the Twin Mistresses will do just fine for themselves for the foreseeable future considering their blinking warning light of a skill set.
