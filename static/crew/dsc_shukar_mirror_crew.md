Shukar has a handful of traits, most notably Discovery, to help elevate pretty poor bases. More sturdy proficiencies combine for a couple ranked gauntlet pairs and can be a formidable option at 45% crit. Discovery megas have hugely buoyed his value, but if they were to dry up, his voyage power relative to the field as dropped too much to be of much use outside the gauntlet. Dual collections are a nice value bump for one of the above average legendary Mirror crew.
