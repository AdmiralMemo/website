'Great Gams Torres' may not have made it past WRG's censors, but we regrettably have less filter here. Brigitte's negatives jump off the page to veteran players (poor skill set and lack of collections), but despite them, the raw numbers will serve most players who employ super rare crew on shuttles and voyages.

Torres' sticker price when it comes to events is certainly deceiving, having been puffed up by multiple megas and the no longer fashionable Klingon bonus. Yet the slow-growing Spy trait and a few edge cases should at some point supplement her twice-per-year variant events.

Fleshing out one of her character's gaping skill holes for anything not named security or engineering, Bump'lanna's four digit DIP score should have no trouble finding a Faction seat and merits a thaw down the line.
