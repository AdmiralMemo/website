Another common pairing...oh wait, yes but this is a good one! A very strong voyager with a heap of useful traits and his ship ability and power makes him essential for the Arena. His individual stats might not be amazing but combined they will absolutely help you hit a four hour voyage. Take this guy over any of the other Rare Klingons and get him on that Bird Of Prey!
