A difficult crew to rank in a vacuum, Kang's value (outside of whatever Collection considerations there are) rests on his Ship Ability. A massive Attack Boost when Triggered from Cloak makes him a singular name in the Captain's Division of Arena and lower Fleet Boss Battle Difficulties. The value of rewards in those areas is questionable, but his dominance there makes him a must-have if that's a part of your game.
