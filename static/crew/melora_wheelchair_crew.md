Ignoring, for the moment, the somewhat nefarious art (seriously, someone needs to tell the WRG relief artist that use of shadow is meant to be exercised with restraint), Melora is a decently useful Super Rare. Coming packaged with the voyage power that continues to make older golds perspire, she starts out with two collections that are not only wide, but have a lot of fairly bad options that you want to avoid, so even if you aren't the type to dive into six packs for a purple, you'll be pleased to see her when she turns up in the portal. The rest of her traits are a pretty binary yes-no on the possibility of further collection potential, so it's fairly easy to eyeball the ceiling of her future value, especially considering that it was a surprise to get even this variant after the 2* seemingly cornered the market. For fans of her episode, or of Daphne Ashbrook's turn in the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie where she violently murdered Sylvester McCoy, she's at least palatable - just don't let those personal feelings get in the way of freezing her once she's past her sell-by date.
