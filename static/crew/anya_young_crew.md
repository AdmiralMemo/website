Anya has a range of strange features much akin to her allasomorphic self. 400% damage at 8 seconds is the nice sweet spot for instant destruction on a Krayton while allowing time for other crew to trigger with Auto mode. Another notch on the diplomat tree is always a plus, assuming one can get her to the prerequisite number or stars, but her skill spread is somewhat disappointing.

She comes in at the mid to low range on several rankings and is quite easily replaced by a lot of existing SEC/ENG crew, most notably Saboteur Garak, who shares her skill order and arena nuke, or Satin Dress Lily, the recent 2020 convergence day giveaway and a rerun event. Instant damage aside, she isn't worth turning into a huge rage monster and smashing up the furniture for.
