Yup, it’s unseasoned applesauce for everyone. Don’t be fooled by her Skill set and order; Kes is a decrepit Super Rare from 2020 and she Voyages like it too.

Kes also doesn’t enjoy the Event pedigree that other “main cast” crew do; two times her number has been called in the game’s history. However, like every crew in the game, much of her value is tied to her Trait list, which is eclectic and has hit on three Collections as it stands, but unlikely to see more.
