Ol' G-ma Kes is a curious card, but considering the kind of cards that Kes gets, she feels about right - just a little bit odd, just a little too weak to be the cornerstone of any roster, but just that little bit unique enough that for the right person, she's going to be a superhero. ENG/MED in any quality is always worth collecting, as I'm sure you're well aware by now, but it's becoming common enough that you need a bit of an edge for it to have a lasting impact. 

Fittingly for someone who looks like her dentures are about to fall out, Grandmother Kes lacks edge, that one thing she does better than anyone else. But for people who are still using Mama Mayweather on voyages; who need a bit of a DIP/ENG push (#2 voyager for the pair); or who are still making that painful transition to all golds on voyages, she's still more than capable of baking you a sugar cookie and tucking you in at night.
