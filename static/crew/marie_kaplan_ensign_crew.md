Ah right, that one Ensign from that…episode…show. A 24th century Redshirt, Kaplan skips the tension building on your roster and shows up already dead on arrival for convenient placement in Cryostasis. The Hero Trait seems to be her only likely chance for value via Events (but we’ve been wrong before - looking at you, Desperate Mega from October 2022) and a second Collection, leaving her out of a job the rest of the time unless you’re a brand new player looking to staff some Shuttles day to day.
