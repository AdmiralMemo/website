After a long session at Quarkâ€™s, Morn finds out that his tab has run a bit too high and now must accept any job to make ends meet. Sadly, Morn will have a hard time finding a job on your roster in the early game due to his disappointing Bases and Voyage power among Rares. Finish him among the last crew of his Rarity and hope in Cryostasis he will pay you off with a few more Collections.
