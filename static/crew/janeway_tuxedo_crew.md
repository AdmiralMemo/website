Welcome to Le Cur de Lion. She's Katrine. And arguably better than Katrine v.1. No longer the best option for Janeway CMD, she does still offer the second best base, which may again be an asset with Groundhog Janeway making her first event appearance in 2019 after a 14 month winter. Katrine's voyage work isn't particularly special, even with a splash of SCI, but in combination with her theoretical event value, she's at least an average crew. With thin, but possible use elsewhere, she's not quite a jack of all trades, but perhaps a 9 or 10 of all trades.
