Once considered an abominable card, Neelix’s stock has risen considerably thanks to his place in four Collections. Neelix’s build is also very light on faction items, meaning any roster can knock him out during the course of a skirmish and reap the Stat-Boosting goodness for years to come. If you’re trying to decide between Immortalizing him or airlocking to save the crew slot, go with the former if you have the Chrons for it.
