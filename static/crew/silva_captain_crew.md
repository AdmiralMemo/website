Mommy La Forge has no Voyage power to speak of, deceptive Gauntlet Proficiencies which don’t translate into any worthwhile use in that feature, and a Trait set so thin you could sneeze through it from across the room. If you get stuck picking her five times from Beholds so bad she’s the best choice, hope she finds herself two Collections one day so you can justify not defenestrating your device.
