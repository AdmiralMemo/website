Q Hefner’s initial impression upon looking at his numbers are as questionable as his choice in evening wear. He debuts at a lower voyage rank than his mega-reward comrade God Q and sports a voyage pair ranking that sits too far down the list to be actively desirable to the seasoned DIP/MED seeking auteur. However a 65% and 45% gauntlet crit awaits his future if you are seduced by his DIP proficiencies. He’s in the same Gauntlet as Trelane and NottingQ, if you combine those heavy hitters together you might just make a few Locutii or Guinanuses swoon with passion.

He doesn’t quite have the stats to make Janeway cave to his desires but his ancillary use in the Gauntlet should sway you to his utility outside of the usual voyage metrics. Having been given two DIP monsters as giveaways in the form of a Pineapple and a Towel it’s going to be a struggle for Q Brannigan to keep up. That being said should one lack his charming features he has enough strength in the numbers to make those extra few minutes on a voyage.
