We’re not sure what T’Pol is summoning with all those candles, but let’s hope it’s more Events and Collections for everyone’s favorite Enterprise-era Vulcan.

Serviceable on Voyages and in Events, the Subcommander probably better fits the mold of Event release aimed at newer players, but hits on a few different areas. Veterans should not turn their nose up at this crew either; with a trio of Collections and two more possible Traits that could cash in, she’s a strong choice in any Super Rare Behold.

Top MED and DIP Bases among Super Rare variants should earn her weekend work for almost any level of roster. Not a standout name, but one that could see repeated use, especially for younger accounts.
