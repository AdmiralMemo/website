Jake-o's Survivalist Trait is incredibly generous, but thanks to CollectionMania (© World Wrestling Entertainment), he parlays that Trait into a bit of value along with his other Collection (Caregiver), but that’s it. Past Mega Events heavily inflate the Event count of a bit player who hangs out in the Wesley-Mayweather range for bonuses, but those weekends may be your only chance to use a crew who doesn't boast any Voyage or Gauntlet utility. If the opportunity cost to acquire this Sisko is anything above peanuts, don't feel bad for skipping him.
