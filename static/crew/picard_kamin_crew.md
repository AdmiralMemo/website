Kamin and listen... A much requested variant of Picard whistles his way into the higher end of the SCI/DIP spectrum, offering a respectable powerup in all three of his skill pairs. His ability to weave iron obviously renders him with an inscrutable MED ability, but I’m not going to quibble for the sake of a more versatile Picard. Whilst he is a great asset on sheer numbers, there are a few considerations to keep an eye on should you ponder citing him.
He is no doubt a good straightforward voyager. However he has nothing to give him an extra event edge outside of Picard events, for his traits are hollow and he has touched the sky. I don’t think the Botanist mega is happening anytime soon. While he sports a top 10 Gauntlet, his traits make it unlikely he ever sees more than a 5% bonus in that area.
Picard is as main cast as they come and combined with strong numbers and a skill set off the beaten path for this crew, he'll get everyday use on most rosters, especially those who didn’t participate in Pupcard’s and Soji Asha’s mega events or are missing out on Boothby’s superior skill set.
