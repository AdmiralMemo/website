Communications Officers from TOS onwards that are not Uhura or Sato tend to get a bit neglected when it comes to Trek appearances and...oh wait, that's Bryce. This is Rhys. I'm getting my ‘yce’s confused again.

Rhys doesn’t quite have the power to play amongst the other crew on Voyages, debuting as “aggressively average” and falling quickly from that “perch” into being merely decrepit.

A solid set of Traits do buoy him over the long term if you decide to Fuse him up in your Legendary Beholds; with his set of Collections already at their ceiling of four and with all the weekend bonuses and global Stat boosts that come with them, feel free to choose Bryce… I mean Rhys, from a Behold without much fear.
