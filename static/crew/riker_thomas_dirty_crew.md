Tommy Boy has the top Common SEC Base and an above-average ENG that will get you through a mission or two in the early days. A good ship ability with shield regeneration that kicks in immediately (though steps up through time phased charges a few times for maximum effect) coupled with quite a few useful traits to hit a few galaxy map nodes means new accounts should level him out the gate. Toss in a hefty three Collections for relatively minimal effort, Transporter Clone Riker is deserving of your Immortalization efforts.
