EV Pike's SEC leads the way here - tops for super rares and paired with plus traits (including Disco). The name Pike has a future as bright as any other, making him a likely event piece and possible dupe candidate. Serviceable on voyages despite a crowded skill set and holding down two collection spots, Pike's peak long-term value and shouldn't have much trouble finding Faction action down the line.
