So I could spend a while talking about how his skill set is quite common but how he is quite well proportioned in CMD/SEC, or how his traits and SCI tertiary are good but nothing amazing compared to other crew. But there is one reason to take this crew and one major reason alone. Events, and his glorious mane of hair.
I can think of only one other person who has been featured in the main cast for two major Star Trek shows, Worf. With Strange New Worlds approaching and Disco season 2 yet to feature a mega based on every aspect of Spock’s journey through madness we can safely assume that Pike events will be often and numerous going forward. Take him, level him, write him awkward fan mail, be shy at a convention with him and enjoy the future of Anson Mount’s Timelines.
