She makes, like, a gazillion Voyages for me' - but we must strive to be less encumbered with horse 
blinders here at the Large Tome.

A former Mega Event Recurring Legendary Crew rarely gets bad reviews because more stars = more good. And it's true that Soji hit the spot on release and gave everyone a nice, juicy MED Voyager. But what else did it give us? Not a Gauntlet option or an Event piece (crossed fingers for a Picard-Trait Mega Event notwithstanding) or an option on Ships or much of a Collection magnet, though she may end up average there over time.

As for her Voyage ability, itâ€™s running out of gas. Maybe positrons decay?

Are we telling you to not choose her from Beholds or Crew Retrieval? Well, no, just weigh her same-day stats against the fantastic tales that usually accompany Recurring Mega Event Legendaries. Soji is far from a dead end, but her edges are more sanded down now than they ever were.
