I think he was crew #1000 or something, right? Mayweather's always gotten the short end of the stick across writing rooms and mediums, but at least good ol' power creep presents a version of Travis with some intermediate value.

Usable Voyage power vs poor skill set has long been the Dragonball Z analog of Prophet Kira vs Pah-Wraith Jake. Who wins that fight depends on your roster construction and how hard you've been veering toward or away from extremely common constructs like CMD/DIP/SEC or CMD/DIP/SCI. This Mayweather has some Voyage juice for a while longer, but even a lower ranked option like Mountain Climber Mayweather will often produce better results thanks to a less recurrent skill combo.

His fairly thin Trait set somewhat limits Mayweather's future Event and Collection potential - help sorely needed for an infrequent Event name. But a Collection in hand is worth two in the bush and EV Suit's advent + expansion in short order should provide value in a varying amount based on the number of Legendary crew needed for the final threshold.  That aforementioned Trait set at least does include two more viable ones, so we could see the ceiling for ostensible crew #1000 hit five Collections, which is a bit of a coup given he has only five traits in total (thanks Hidden Traits!).
