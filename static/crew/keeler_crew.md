Whodathunk Kirk would fall for Bases this low? Keeler is generally bereft of power, but there’s a little something for both the new and the old.

She’s *only* a 2-Skiller, but DIP/MED is not a stack you tend to see walls of in the Gauntlet (outside of those insufferable Guinan Gauntlets), so Edith and her fistfuls of elevated Crit Gauntlets could give her Proficiencies room to maneuver for fresh rosters. On the flip side, her trio of Collections should see one or two more hung on the wall before it’s all said and done and if you’ve been playing the game for a few years, that’s all you need to see from your Super Rares.
