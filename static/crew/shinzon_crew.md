Folks, Shinzon is just a hot pile of mess. An early 2021 Trait audit made him an honorary Romulan, which instantly gave him more relevance than his contributions to the previous five years of the game combined. Until he's in two (or God forbid three) Collections, don't even think about letting him hog a Crew Slot on your roster. Even then he's only a vanity prize for late game Collection chasers.
