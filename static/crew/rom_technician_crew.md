Rom is an odd juxtaposition of great ENG power with scant Cadet Missions eligibility. He has a few uses in the early game, but generally isn’t worth the resources as young, Trainer-strapped rosters struggle to keep ahead of the influx of new Event cards. With a Trait list on the meaty side for Uncommon crew, he’s more of a juicy mid-game leveling project for rosters looking to build up their Collection Stat Boosts.
