Can you tell me how to get… how to get to Carpenter Street?

Detroit Archer is now decrepit as that city on Voyages, but still enjoys a strong Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup duo of Events and Collections due to a strong Trait list. A quartet of Collections, room for three more in his Trait list, and the Events that come along with them, plus a renewed interest from WRG in both Enterprise and Archer himself for bonuses, gives him a lot of value even though there’s little daily use left.
