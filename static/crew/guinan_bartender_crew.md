Fittingly for someone who's been to the Nexus, Bartender Guinan is a crew somewhat in purgatory. There's a cost associated with citing gauntlet reward crew since they're able to drop after rotating out, meaning that her voyage potential may not be realized any time soon on some rosters. If you do have her finished, she's still capable of making runs, particularly in the Marksman seat, but is not the powerhouse of old.

Guinan's gauntlet ability has waned slightly too with the proliferation of Locutus and a few MED/SEC names, though she remains untouchable and dominant in her 45%+ gauntlets. A great rotational gauntlet piece (or anchor for newer players) and an exclusive, valuable spot in the gauntlet collection comprise significant value for a single crew, even if you feel hamstrung by her fusion situation.
