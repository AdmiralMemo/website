"My name is Guinan. I tend bar, and I gauntlet."

There are some ups and downs to get to where Guinan ultimately lands on the Gauntlet scale, which is near the top. She dominates her 1/2 skill pair better than any crew dominates theirs and has some of the most exclusive 45%+ crit sets in the game. When she hits on those, Guinan is a free win button that you can push through one, two, or even three fatigues. And if Locutus didn't exist, the conversation around her would be very interesting indeed.

Unfortunately, he *does* infringe on her DIP and DIP/SEC rolls, brings more overall power and flexibility to the table, and will often be a wall that you'll want to re-roll out of. If you luck into Guinan early on, she can absolutely carry your Fave Five, but on complete rosters is more of a rotational piece.

Guinan is now a non-starter on Voyages after debuting six years ago, and her Trait set is pretty light, only sparking two Stat-boosting Collections but possible room for four more if WRG ever runs out of more viable ones. Notedly one of the two current Collections is the Gauntlet-Exclusive one, which provides the best value per Immortalized crew in the game.
