Fittingly for someone who's been to the Nexus, Bartender Guinan is a crew somewhat in purgatory these days. There's a cost associated with citing gauntlet reward crew now that they're able to drop after rotating out, meaning that her voyage potential may not be realized any time soon on some rosters. If you do have her finished, she's still useful there, but names like Vina, Merry Troi, and Humbled Archer have begun chipping away at her value.

Guinan's gauntlet power is waning too with the proliferation of Locutus again and a few MED/SEC names, though she remains untouchable and dominant in her monthly 65% crit gauntlet. A great rotational gauntlet piece (or anchor for newer players), worthwhile voyage value, and an exclusive collection spot comprise significant value for a single crew, even if you feel hamstrung by her fusion situation.
