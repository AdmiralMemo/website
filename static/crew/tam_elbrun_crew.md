Who Whatman? Tan Elbow? He comes from an episode with a lot of heart, but Elbrun's value is paper thin in game. If you're the Scarecrow or Cowardly Lion and want to use your pal's pal, Tam gets a single 45% Gauntlet and a respectable pair roll within it. Beyond that he's merely a wonky Trait set which is due to max out at anywhere from two to four Collections, depending on how the wind blows.
