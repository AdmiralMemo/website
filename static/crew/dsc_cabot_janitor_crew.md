An early game Collection stepping stone, Dr. Jan Itor is your introduction to the wonderful world of Tribbles, as he and Koloth are the only non-Super Rare or Legendary options for Tribble Trouble. 

After a brief detour to mention his strong, albeit short-lived Voyage work, we arrive at Cadet missions where his Starfleet tag gives him at least a chance to contribute. Unfortunately his best trait here, resourceful, doesn't line up with any rare reward nodes for ENG or SEC, meaning it's somewhat unnecessary for 3-starring all of the missions. 

He'll be worth immortalizing for that easy global stat boost and can be used in a pinch for Voyages and Cadet missions, and is among the most valuable Cadets due to a quintet of Collections, Uncommon Crew notwithstanding.
