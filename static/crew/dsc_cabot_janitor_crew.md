An early game collection stepping stone, Dr. Jan Itor is your introduction to the wonderful world of Tribbles, as he and Koloth are the only non-super rare or legendary options for Tribble Trouble.

After a brief detour to mention his strong, albeit short-lived voyage work, we arrive at cadet missions where his Starfleet tag gives him at least a chance to contribute. Unfortunately his best trait here, resourceful, doesn't line up with any rare reward nodes for ENG or SEC, meaning it's somewhat unnecessary for 3-starring all of the missions.

He'll be worth immortalizing for that easy global stat boost and can be used in a pinch for voyages and cadet missions, but will rarely be the best option on even the youngest of rosters.
