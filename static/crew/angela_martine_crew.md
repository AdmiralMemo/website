Hell hath no fury...Well, Angela wasn't exactly scorned, but one of the biggest Romantic SEC Bases and a nickel will get you a cuppa coffee. (sorry, we're working from a very old joke book)

That's just to say that while she may have some Shuttle-friendly Bases and a few viable Traits, her thawpertunities may be few and far between. But only one of those three dominos has fallen in the Collections tab, so things may at least improve there. Not the best long term profile out there for endgame rosters, but at least some sort of value for every level of player.
