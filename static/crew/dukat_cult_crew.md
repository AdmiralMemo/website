Pah-wraith jokes aside, where we feel the love is Dukat's Trait potential. A theoretical seven Collection ceiling would be monumental value that would have Dukat demanding that, well...you build a monument to him on Cardassia.

His only other area of contribution is Event Shuttles, given he has the Traits to be called upon somewhat often and a Skill set that is commonly featured in seating.
