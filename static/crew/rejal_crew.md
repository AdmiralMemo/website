Pure SCI ability isn’t everything as demonstrated by Gilora here. One of the most used cards in the early days of the game due to her work in all Cadet Missions, a healthy SCI Base stat and two extra non-Rarity Collections, with room in her Trait list for another. Her broad Skill set gives her plenty of work during very early Voyages. Her Ship Ability is fairly good with a +1000 Shield Regeneration bonus but her main use will be in Cadet Missions. If you fancy your hand at Gauntlet she might just help you get a Streak or two. Just keep her away from O’Brien, there could be...tension.
