One of the most worthwhile Rare crew to complete due to his Trait list, Starfleet Uniform Khan is valuable due to his inclusion in four Stat-boosting Collections, opportunities for two more as they are added monthly, and Fleet Boss Battles Node solving (unless you have his Legendary big brother Wrathful).
