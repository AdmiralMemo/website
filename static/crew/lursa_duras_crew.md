The other Duras sister has a fairly decent #8 CMD base with a decent proficiency score. She can work all weekend but her CMD stat won’t be the reason you keep her around.
See B’Etor for details on how they fuse into the Duras Sisters but it’s probably the best option rather than immortalising them. You can find better CMD crew once the cadet missions have been completed and her voyage score is not keeping her on.
