A variety of traits help suppliment O'Brien's otherwise lacklustre event pace, but this variant is more of a Jack of all trades anyway. DIP/ENG representation is middling at best, which gives him an outside chance at early-to-mid-game voyage work and double collections pump up his fully fused value even more. Worth a look in the arena where short initialization +Acc/shield repair and strong passive numbers can be situationally useful. He's docked a point for a fairly expensive equip cost, but the immortalized value is worth it.
