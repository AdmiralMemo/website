The Dishonor Hall must accept discommendation in open council. There is no other alternative, Worf! In your father’s day, the Honor Hall held special meaning among Klingons. The greatest of us all, Kahless, held strong as the shining example of wisdom, warrior nobility, and shrewd honor spending.

And even as Duras’ treachery snuck glorified event crew such as Borg Queen Seven and Nanoprobe Phlox into the Hall’s ranks, we could accept them as expensive trophies. But for you to attempt something so repugnant as this…Kal’Hyah Worf…is an affront to true Klingonhood. You have sullied a once proud and glorious chamber.

Listen to the fat Klingon, folks - he’s right. Worf’s highlight as a strong weekend shuttle pilot also comes with the caveat that he’s been no stranger to quiet years and that’s not a luxury that a crew with a 100,000 honor buy-in can afford. We definitely want a more consistent return on our investment than that. With laughably few traits to keep his event clip afloat during lean years, don’t be surprised if Worf asks you to join him in the trial of deprivation on the path to Kal’Hyah.

The numbers elsewhere are truly depressing. Debuting with a voyage score that fellow Honor Hall crew Kahless should reach in 2024, his SEVENTH year in the game, strongly undercuts the “but he has MED” crowd in concert with his severe lack of anti-matter traits. He also proffers extremely weak collection value, the worst among honor hall crew, as the number of legendary crew with at least one collection surges toward five hundred.
