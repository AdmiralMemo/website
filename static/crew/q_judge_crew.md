Numbers in the right places for Voyages, Gauntlet, Ship Battles...except, oh yeah, he's eight years old and those numbers suck. Born in the wrong era, most of Q’s assets no longer hold up in modern Timelines.

Attributes of note include a 65% Gauntlet set with good Proficiencies, but distributed too flatly to make an impact, a growing heap of Collection value, and frankly strong Evasion that would play on Ships if you can find a palatable way to Fuse him.

Judge's Event count keeps chugging along between some of WRG’s favorite Traits and de Lancie’s variant opportunities. Though his Bases are poor, they’re in the right Skill set to find Shuttle seating and he can certainly help keep requisition Shuttles afloat which would otherwise be failboats. Despite the lack of power for this launch card, there are enough areas of interest to keep him ahead of swathes of awful, no hope Behold picks.
