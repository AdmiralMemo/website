Yes.

He’s the best Bolian in the game.
He’s the best barber in the galaxy.
He helped Worf conquer his fear of scissors.
Picard impersonated him to escape thugs.
He’s one of the best Super-Rare Voyaging cards in the game.
He has three Collections out the door.
He has a great ship ability with no trigger or penalty.

Look if you’re wanting me to say ‘no’ to something about Mot, you’re just going to have to go read another crew note. Yes he’s a Tuesday pack, but from Nightmare Mode enjoyers to whales, VIP0 to people who swore they’d quit over the latest Gauntlet result, you could find a lot worse to spend your 650 Dil on.

Nah I’m just kidding, don’t actually spend Dilithium on him...unless you want to...if only there was a website to BUY DILITHIUM....hmmm....oh yes, Mot, that’s right!  Mot is a fine card, now please just trim the sides, not too short.
