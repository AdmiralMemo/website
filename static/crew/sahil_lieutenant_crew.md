Our listening post lost all its glow
The day that it lost you
But he gained all his glitter the day you said go
And his silver turned to blue

Mr. Blue announced his arrival with a bang, bringing hope and inspiration to couch potatoes everywhere. No matter how many decades you've spent in the same room, you too can be recognized as the greatest explorer of your generation.

Sahil enjoys some lasting value due to his quartet of Collections, above average still in today’s game, and can still pitch it on Voyages despite a crowded Skill set and power crept rankings. His ancillary Traits also give him a shot to pitch in on the weekends and that same common Skill set which dings him on Voyages buoys his Event Shuttle seating chances. Discovery Mega Events (“somehow, Discovery Mega Events returned”) may be the only other chance for him to shine Thursday-Monday.
