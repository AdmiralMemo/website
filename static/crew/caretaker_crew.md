Like other exclusive crew, there's a bit extra to unpack about Banjo Man. As a card, he's just fantastic and incredibly useful day to day. On voyages he has a delicious skill set which is weighted to put him on the right part of the ENG/MED curve and in conjunction with a good overall score is unlikely to be completely displaced from those voyages any time soon. Even more impressive than guaranteed voyage job security (which is hard to do) is Caretaker's gauntlet résumé.

His #1 ENG proficiency isn't just good, it's stupid good. The names below him include a 1-skill crew and a super rare. That monster ENG roll gives him ownership of four ranked gauntlet pairs as well as the top ENG/MED pair by a bigger margin over number two than any other skill combo - almost 300 points. I'll cut the accolades short, but suffice it to say, he's a banger. His biggest (only) weakness is rarely exceeding 25% crit, but with such a huge lead over the competition, your best option against him is usually 50 merits.

So what do we do with our copies of Banjo Man? There's no clear-cut answer. It's certainly tempting to want to feed him citations for his prodigious voyage potential. If you did that before the changes to gauntlet rewards (✋guilty) and land another copy, do you keep him? His voyage offering is still unique enough that you shouldn't feel bad for doing so if you have space and you can always fly the double Caretaker formation in gauntlet. But if you haven't cited him yet, you're getting 50% or more of his benefit with just that first star. Stand pat or add stars, you're going to love what The Caretaker offers no matter what.
