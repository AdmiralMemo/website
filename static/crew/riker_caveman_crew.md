In the vein of an Evil Kirk or ‘Ultimate Evolution’ Riker, Proto is a freezer body who you’ll thaw a few times each year to boost your Faction Shuttles. His shot at daily use lies on Ships and is a curious thing. 250% Instant Damage is a little better than average for Super Rares without a Trigger and pairing it with a six second fuse is juicy, but it comes at the price of a hefty Accuracy handicap. It’s hard to know what to make of it in a vacuum, but should be worth playing around with if you aren’t happy with your current setup. For Collections, he’s managed to find himself with a ceiling of three which is not bad for his Rarity.
