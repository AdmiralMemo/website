If you smell what the Chef is cooking, you'd know he's serving up a pretty tasty dish, with just a hint of that "taken from the god-awful Enterprise finale" aroma to add complexity to the bouquet. Headlining a record-setting weekday dilithium pack stuffed with twelve (!!!) other crew, the Chef is among the rarest crew in the game until he hits the portal. 

As the only Riker with MED and SCI as well as a hefty DIP base, Chef Riker is the rare main cast card where all three of his skills are variant-best. Handy, if you had him since release, as he popped off for a five event feature 2019 and should continue to provide plus weekend value thanks to ST:Picard.

He doesn't stand out elsewhere, lacking Gauntlet prospects and with a punchless ship ability, but his middling Voyage total is uniquely-skilled enough that he will probably find more work there than the raw numbers project. With the long history of underwhelming, underpowered Riker variants before him, it's an easy call to snap up this version when you have the chance.
