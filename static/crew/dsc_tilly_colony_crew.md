Three years of waiting for a purple Tilly variant has borne rotten fruit. No side perks in the way of collections, arena, or gauntlet and the base/voyage power numbers belong to a 2017 crew.

A pair of untapped event traits, Explorer and Undercover Operative, may both need to hit to keep afloat a character in Tilly who has only averaged one event per year outside of the protective covering of Discovery megas. As the #19, #15, and #16 base for those three traits, it may take the right featured crew to produce enough ENG seats in any given faction event to make her worth thawing.
