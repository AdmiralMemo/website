On this week's edition of “People looking unamused over their tablet devices” we have the Annorax apologist himself. If you are looking for someone to judge you yet silently agree with your nefarious methods, let Chuckles be your "guest."  
Debuting as one of the high points in the Voyager mega his numbers earn him a spot in the upper echelons of DIP/SCI crew, almost of a level with Surak and Pupcard. As Chakotay variants go, he's only one of two legendaries and the other, Temporal Prisoner, is starting to show his age (if one can really age while time-displaced). Still, despite the dearth of Chakotay variants, I wouldn't count on a Beltran-aissance giving the Krenim prisoner much event use. But his numbers earn him his keep on your everyday roster, well, that and the ability to build a hot-tub at the drop of a PADD.
