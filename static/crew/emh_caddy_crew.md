As Jimmy Demaret once said "Golf and sex are about the only things you can enjoy without being good at". You can tell by the smile on Doc’s face that he’s in full agreement, having just spent a few hours on the back Nine.

A former top flight voyager, Doc continues to abide there due to his plus skill set and an absurd Antimatter hit rate, essentially guaranteeing him a trait match with every voyage. Folding in his other attributes, even elderly players will have a use for this Doc variant. A worthwhile collection profile is an easy acquisition on its own, while an oft-seated DIP base sees enough event bonuses each year to provide thawpertunities aplenty for this very spiffy dresser.
