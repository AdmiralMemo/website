Like many pre-Power Crept LaForges, Musketeer is a well-rounded crew with fingers in many of Wesley's pies (sorry for that mental image. It’s an episode reference. Just…nevermind). Owner of a sunset scorecard, Muskie can pitch in in more areas of the game than not.

In the casino, a Caretaker-sniping SEC/ENG pair hits 45% Crit often enough to make him a worthwhile inclusion, even on established rosters. Adding in a steady Event clip, strong Collection profile, and six second-activating Ship Ability gives him possibilities for work in just about every phase of the game, even The Next Phase.
