Ever wonder what she's carrying in her basket? The answer is all her freaking traits. Thirteen (!!!) to help trigger voyage and event bonuses when you least expect them. She's well into double-digit events and sports a top shelf DIP base to go with it. Impressive voyage numbers overall and for her primary are accompanied by a flattering-for-DIP skill set and should provide additional use between event bonuses. 2020's collection size re-work pushes Troi's spot in the Vulcan collection back into the limelight as just one more reason to select her in your behold.
