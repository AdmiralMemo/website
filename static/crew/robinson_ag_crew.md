It may be one of his traits, but very little about A.G. Robinson's card is actually inspiring. Debuting with the worst voyage rank for a new three-skill crew in the game's history, Mr. Robinson is born into a kind of statistical irrelevance normally reserved for crew three or four years older than he is.

As the herald of the A Little Stroll collection, you would think the news would be better on the collection front, except that, as of this writing, neither of his collections requires gold crew to complete, again rendering him superfluous. 

If you want to be (over)prepared for events, it is possible that a Pilot or Explorer event would buy him a weekend out of cryostasis, and a quick but relatively short +10 Evasion plus attack speed bonus could be useful in the right Arena lineup.

He may cut an impressive figure in those spiffy orange duds, but, statistically, he's all dressed up with nowhere to go.
