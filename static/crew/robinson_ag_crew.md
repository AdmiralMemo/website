It may be one of his traits, but very little about A.G. Robinson's card is actually inspiring. Having debuted with the worst Voyage rank for a three-Skill crew in the game's history to that point, Mr. Robinson was born into a kind of statistical irrelevance normally reserved for crew three or four years older than he is.

With an ENG Primary that can have trouble finding seating in events and a putrid Secondary SCI, A.G. has already settled into the low end of the hoards of Event/Collection-only pieces which youâ€™ll want to (or be forced to) passively Fuse. 

Despite a thin Trait set, Robinson has gotten very lucky by finding not one but two Collections from hidden Traits (ent and evsuit), and has room to grow those two, plus a visible Trait Collection, to five.

He may cut an impressive figure in those spiffy orange duds, but statistically he's all dressed up with nowhere to go.
