Voyages are the highlight of this Stamets' portfolio - his skill set is underrepresented both in terms of power and options, with only a single former mega and campaign option among them. He may even see his ranks increase in the short term as the month-to-month collection bonuses presumably level out. Regardless, he and Leucon are really the only names in that skill set who you'd want to acquire solely for their voyage considerations.

The cupboard isn't exactly stocked beyond that important daily use area of the game, but Stamets should be good for a few events per year even with a supporting trait list pointed directly at voyage antimatter rather than surprise event bonuses.
