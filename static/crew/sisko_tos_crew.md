This anachronistic Sisko’s primary flip-flops from base to voyages, but neither is particularly effective. Between a gross voyage power/skill set combo and having no base better than third among Sisko variants, 1701’s best chance at relevance is either an unprecedented third re-run of his event feature or something like a Bajoran mega. His spot in the Inspiring collection should be out of reach for all those except the unluckiest.
