Persis shines in the early game with her Cadet Missions eligibility, giving her decent Bases an opportunity to clear Nodes for you, and her Traits shall also bless early game players with three non-Rarity Collections. Also, I’m pretty sure she’s wearing the same style jeans that kids these days are wearing.
