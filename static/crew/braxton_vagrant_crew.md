Ironically, considering the charges of vagrancy, this particular Braxton does in fact have a home - a warm bed and hot meal waiting for him right here in tier 10. That joke worked better before dynamic tiering. Uh, just fiddle with the tier sliders or something.

Somehow WRG has spun poo into gold and has found Braxton a trio of Collections from his viable Traits, but thereâ€™s little left to offer outside of bonus Events borne from those Traits. Give him a nice cold bed in Cryostasis between infrequent weekend work,
