Much like her engineering, whatever value Tilly could or should have is purely theoretical. Her Traits are as barren as Regula I and the slowing of Discovery Mega Events has left her high and dry in the Events department. Averaging less than an Event per year outside of them, this is a crew that may sit in Cryostasis for years between uses. This is my pick for the worst Legendary crew in the game.
