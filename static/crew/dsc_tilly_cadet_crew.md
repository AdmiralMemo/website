Tilly's event work would be safe if Discovery megas follow TOS' suit and shift to bridge crew only, but that's more or less the extent of her usefulness. With poor traits and a curious lack of variant events as well as a handful of prior ENG primary mega crew, you may not use her for much else. A fine event piece with a big bonus tally to date, but don't be surprised if that's all she does on your roster.
