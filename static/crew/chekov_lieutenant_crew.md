There are many things to like about this Chekov. The way his shapely hips flow in this unappealing brown pyjama suit. His perfectly parted hair. His strong voyage score. Hm. His base SEC? I’m sorry, there’s just not much to say about poor young Pavel here.

He was a fine daily use card on release, but when you’re surrounded by crew who offer different and better utility left and right, you do tend to get lost in the crowd without collections or a particularly noteworthy ship ability. On the plus side, four of Chekov’s six events have been Faction based, so he’s probably going to be worth unfreezing eventually - just not any time soon.
