Klingon Judo Crusher, as she is colloquially known, has enjoyed a long life as a viable Voyager, but that time is sadly coming to an end, as her power sags and WRG inevitably prints better crew in her Skill set, order, and to fill the Anti-matter seats she previously clutched so tightly. 

But never fear, Bev has a trio of Collections and one additional viable Trait to give her solid footing in that area, and while Beverly Crusher Events are not plentiful, she can cash in using those four Collection Traits on weekends when they provide a bonus. 

We’d be doing you a disservice if we also didn’t mention that she is one of the top crew, with a 20s Cycle, for the Hull Repair meta for Fleet Boss Battles, and one of only a few in the Time Portal (as of this writing) along with Laborer Kirk and Dereth. Once others enter the Time Portal she becomes a little less essential for that meta, but you only need a single star to cash in on this stellar Ship Ability since she does not provide an Attack Boost.
