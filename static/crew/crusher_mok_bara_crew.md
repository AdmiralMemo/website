You thought the year 2020 was weird? We've had a stellar Harry Kim variant, our first legendary Ezri (also a baller), and now a Monster Crusher.

With other names like Scotty getting power player versions in 'recent' times, who else from the long list of forgotten names do you think will have their turn in line? Leave your guesses in the comment section and don't forget to Like and Subscribe!

Voyages are the main course here, which is fine since Bev has only given us nibbles on the weekend. For whatever it's worth, her bases are far and away the best for variant events, but she'll need some help from her traits to earn her keep there.

Bev's top ten voyage score lasted for all of two hours before new collection bonuses dropped her a rank, but rank shmank, her numbers are simply the best for MED/DIP. In fact her MED secondary is the largest helping of that skill found in the top twenty voyage names. DIP may overrun most rosters, but Merry Worf Crusher has a great power/skill set blend to make her a voyage anchor for a long time to come.
