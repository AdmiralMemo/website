We’re doing a kindness listing the voyage score for the worst CMD/DIP/SEC super rare voyager in the game, but it doesn’t belong as a tool on your roster, nor her boarding damage or weak gauntlet numbers. The Empress also had the misfortune of two overlapping Sato and Mirror events, not that it would have made a huge difference. Her DIP is still good enough to pop for one or two event shuttles per year, but a Professor in the hand is worth 2.18 in the Mirror Universe.
