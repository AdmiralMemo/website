If you're here, it's either because you're wondering if Lucy is worth immortalizing all those collection crew or your Elusive Treasures behold made you go "huh, I didn't know I could get her from beholds." First, the crew. Janeway was milk carton material for over a year when her events dried up, but with them picking back up in 2019, her respectable DIP base will be an asset, even if she'll rarely have room to use them outside of variant, thanks to her thoroughly bad traits. With #100 being the new average on voyages, Lucy is at least competent there, if unspectacular.

Is she worth the collection effort? If your focus is pure performance, then no. Odo and Kim are rarely crew you want to take a star of in any circumstance, let alone being worth citations. The other five release crew are solid-to-great, and so if you're sitting with a 3/5 Lucy and she pops in an Elusive Treasures pack, then that may save you a huge chunk of honor if you desire her. With Chef Riker joining that collection, and thus opening the door for more additions, the price for this homely Gothic protagonist may well end up only trending cheaper.
