Well it seems as though Security Chief Tuvok just got an upgrade! EV Suit Tuvok is pretty much an all round stellar addition to the game. His voyage numbers are top notch and he will be one of the first to sit on any SEC/CMD shuttle seat. 200% Damage at 6s is a huge boon for any budding Arena user and gives him a ton of viability to shake up the Commander ranks. Sadly we see too many SEC/CMD crew for my liking, even the worst Super Rare cards will outpace him but if you get him early enough in your game his use will be...logical.
