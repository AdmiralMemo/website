A relative dud in Über campaign terms, Mariner is helped out primarily by what you don’t see. Very much lacking in utility, she at least claims a couple hidden Traits to get her on the Collection board with EV Suit and Animated, neither of which seem likely to factor into future Events. Thin on relevant front-facing Traits, she may only ever work out on weekends for variant-flavored adventures.

With woeful Voyage power, you’ll likely only see Mariner pitch in on the weekend, when her CMD Base will shine.
