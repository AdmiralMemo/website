If only you could hear yourselves… ”CMD/DIP/SUCK” Why the very term is skillist. Voyages are no more than a rare sets only club. Luckily Azetbur has paid her club dues.

Voyagey, basey, collectiony, and an event reward? Sign us up! Even if you’re not a sucker for women in stiff leather and chainmail, Azetbur contributes from enough angles to make her a worthwhile pickup for any roster. There are a few red light holes to her game and a normally beneficial MED skill doesn’t do as much to help her anti-matter seating as it typically does, but she’s a valuable black sheep Klingon with some fun trait and skill juxtapositions to help her stand out and has power to last.
