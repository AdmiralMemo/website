You don't often see Legendary crew with a Base ranked in the triple digits, but where that might signal the Gauntlet horn, Dax is more like the Gauntlet kazoo. Built like a (very) budget Bartender Guinan, Bride hangs her hat on a serviceable DIP roll and a pair of 45% Gauntlets to make her a sometimes-include for players in the early-to-midgame. And while bad Bases and iffy Proficiencies mean she's no longer a Voyager, the profile perks up from there.

Dax is still a bankable Event name, even if she won't repeat that Stellar 2017, and has hit on five of her Traits to provide further weekend bonuses. As a 4th Shuttler or requisition piece, she'll collect bonuses often enough to make the investment worthwhile, in this area at least. Tacking on a few Collection spots years after her release with more waiting in the wings has helped to supplement the value of a card whose surface level ranks clearly show her age.
