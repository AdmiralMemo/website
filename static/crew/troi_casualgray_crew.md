If this were a Super Rare or Legendary crew, we’d be applauding her daily use metrics, but when you get dominated by Bus Seat Jake Sisko, how much do your per-rarity stat ranks really matter? Her saving grace is cadet eligibility five days a week and a cheap equip cost, as you might expect from a Common crew.

If you’re taking the scenic route in leveling your crew, you could probably find a spot or two for Troi to pitch in, but if your concern is efficiency then mash that airlock button until her traits begin to materialize into collections.
