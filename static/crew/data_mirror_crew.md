The Mr. Potato Head of Trek characters, many of Data's variants seem to have the same solid core with just some external tweaks from crew to crew. That's not a bad thing; they're all pretty reliable and Data events should rebound from a quiet 2019 to continue to provide value to his variants. Mirror's voyage power has been bruised lately from the run of SEC/ENG crew in 2019 and an ever-sinking voyage rank, but an ENG (or MED) primary crew with guaranteed event work will always be a roster piece worth acquiring.
