A limited Event/Collection crew is what you have in this off-the-beaten-path Vulcan from Enterprise; up to five possible Collections and the Trait-based Events that go with them will be his enduring value. If you’ve come upon a Fully-Fused Kov in the early game he may still go on a Voyage or three, but only until you’ve found Legendary crew to pass the Voyage baton to.
