Captain Ndoye, as she was known at the time, was part of the delegation that greeted the Discovery upon its visit to Earth of the 32nd Century. She had a shoot first, ask questions later mentality with regards to diplomacy, which immediately informed us the viewer of the direction future Earth will take.

Fitting, then, that she joins Timelines as a powerful (by Super Rare standards) CMD/SEC crew who only has Diplomacy as an afterthought. A hefty 250% Instant Damage ability that comes online in a speedy 6s is slightly hampered by a boarding trigger (boarding a ship of dilithium raiders out of Titan, perhaps?) fits her personality, as does a respectable amount of Shuttle potential should her traits hit during a Faction. Speaking of traits: while she only has 2 Collections for now, she’s got a great chance at picking up 3 more which makes her a great investment now no matter where you are in your game progression. As for gauntlet…well to say that she’s dead on arrival is an understatement. But at least she’ll look great doing it?
