Some of my favorite art in the game could have me throwing citations at Vash in a moment of weakness, but that's not a recommendation for the average player. Top ten SCI ranks for base and voyage should be given their due, as they'll earn the troublesome Vash daily work on the majority of rosters. It's the long term forecast that's the tricky bit.

Owning the second most populous skill set and a variant event tally down in Scotty territory, Vash doesn't have a rosy profile to be an "age well" candidate. The aforementioned sturdy ranks and eclectic trait set make her a fine crew to behold or star up, but if you're playing the long game, look for a crew likely to be longer-lasting.

If you're a fan of Jean-Luc's sassy foil, this Vash will perform alright as Surak-lite for voyages and perhaps catch a few weeks of event work, but the card is just not nearly as titillating as Q(uark)'s on-screen partner in crime.
