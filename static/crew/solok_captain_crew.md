The very definition of a “Vulcan dick”, Solok antagonizes Sisko with his insufferable Vulcan “superiority” and even steals the American pastime from him!

It's rare that a Legendary card has arguably less long term benefits than a Super Rare equivalent, but comparing the Captain of the T'Kumbra with the Captain of the Logician baseball team (seriously, how did Solok talk his crew into that?), you end up feeling like he comes up short. Sure, he'll add to two Collections, but he lacks the fun vanity of his Super Rare variant and his Voyage power is a snore.

Solok might squeeze onto an Event shuttle here or there, but isn’t a recommended investment from star one and lacks a lot of the depth that gives other crew enduring value.
