It's rare that a Legendary card has arguably less long term benefits than a Super Rare equivalent, but comparing the Captain of the T'Kumbra with the Captain of the Logician baseball team (seriously, how did Solok talk his crew into that?), you end up feeling like he comes up short. Sure, he'll add to your Vulcan collection, but he lacks the fun vanity of his 4* variant, the skill set is a snore, and if you weren't sick of seeing the words new top 10 SCI base already, hoo boy will you be now that we're in a Vulcan mega. 

That being said, his numbers are good enough for daily use if you luck into fusing him through recaps, and he avoids the pitfalls of 'human, Starfleet, Federation' by snagging the most event heavy racial trait in the game, plus the nicely esoteric Writer, which is quickly becoming my new favourite dark horse for mega theme, alongside Brat, Rich and Special Envoy.
