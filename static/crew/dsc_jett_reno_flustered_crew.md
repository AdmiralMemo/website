Storing up Disco SCI bases is not unlike trying to get a drink of water from a waterfall - it's worth doing, but then you drown. Reno is the #20 (count it, #20) ranked Disco SCI base, behind some very common names, and even in a Faction heavy mega, you'd struggle to use her on anything but requisition shuttles unless you either determinedly ignored, or weren't here for, a lot of those names.

That being said, she has quite the resume to take the sting out of that slightly clunky primary, including dual collections, the still uncommon MED/ENG pairing, a voyage ranking on the right side of useable for the skill set, and the possibility of variants ahead. This is one instance where you don't want to be flustered - take a cool, even headed look at your roster, at your Disco bases, at your MED/ENG crew, and decide if she's about to become your next cornerstone, or just a luxury pick.
