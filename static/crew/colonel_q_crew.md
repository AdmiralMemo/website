It takes a certain level of suck to make you want to avoid pulling event packs just in case you get the 5*, but the Qolonel manages it. Maybe a year ago, he wouldn't have been putrid, but that was before the Prisoner/Interrogator mega spunked his event chances away. Even in this era of unexpected relevance through traits, the Qolonel is a zero, his biggest win being +10 Accuracy at 3 seconds in the Arena, but let's be honest, there's nothing here that Ardra can't do backwards with high heels on. In short: no.
