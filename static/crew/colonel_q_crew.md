With a quick reminder to everyone that the Confederacy lost the American Civil War, Colonel Q is decrepit statistically with little to offer you other than his Trait list, which may increase his Collection count from three to four when his last viable Trait gets called into action. The Colonel can be the Crew you choose from a bad Legendary Behold, then you look at his Big Book note and think… “ok, he’s not THAT bad I guess, if I just follow the Traits.”
