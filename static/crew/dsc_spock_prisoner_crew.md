Spocks and outrageous Event histories just go hand in hand. Even if he didn’t debut with a strong Base (he did) or have a Primary Skill that shows up on over 30% of Faction Seats (he does), he’d still provide a mouth-watering number of Faction Action opportunities!

The rest of this card doesn’t disappoint either; worthwhile Voyage numbers with a SEC/SCI pair that can be hard to stack at the Legendary level, a fast Attack Boost on Ships that newer players could utilize, and a mid-level Collection profile. With top notch art from the Arm & Hammer poster boy, this is one prisoner who you shouldn’t let escape.
