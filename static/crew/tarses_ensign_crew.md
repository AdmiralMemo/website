How dare you! You who immortalize Romulans invoke the Big Bookâ€™s tiers to support your traitorous arguments. It is an offense to everything I hold dear. And to hear those tiers used to subvert cadet missions. Nurse Kes is a great card. Her name stands for integrity and Thursday cadet eligibility. You dirty her name when you speak of tiers. She loved cadet missions, but you, Captain, corrupt them. You undermine our very way of farming medical lessons. I will expose you for what you are. I've brought down bigger men than you!
