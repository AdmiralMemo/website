Another of Rikerâ€™s Angels, our floating angel here can work all the weekday Cadet Missions and still have enough energy to help out in Ship Battles. She is useful for clearing lots of Mission Nodes and is absolutely essential for new players, plus has picked up a non-Rarity Collection, with another Trait in her pocket for later. Keep her, cherish her, treat her well and she will do the same for you.
