Upgraded Wesley Crusher isnâ€™t too much better than his common counterpart. His only noteworthy attribute is the prodigy trait which, in combination with his top two skills, offers a smattering of early-game node unlocks and lone worthwhile collection spot. Not a recommended cadet name, despite the Starfleet tag - instead look for uncommon crew who are also female or alien to kill two birds with one stone.
