Upgraded Wesley Crusher isnâ€™t too much better than his Common counterpart. His only noteworthy attribute is the Prodigy Trait which, in combination with his top two Skills, offers a smattering of early-game Node unlocks and lone worthwhile Collection spot. Not a recommended Cadet name, despite the Starfleet Trait - instead look for Uncommon crew who are also Female or Alien to kill two birds with one stone.
