Just as I thought to myself “Gosh I do wish I could complete my La Forge family bridge crew,” lo and behold here is Daddy La Forge looking down at us with fatherly disdain. Why do I suddenly feel guilty about something I’ve done? 

The most exciting crew to grace our roster he is not, but he’s a great example of WRG delving into the depths of TNG lore in order to pull a classic “one scene wonder with amazing stats” maneuver. Solid SCI/MED voyagers are not exactly hard to come by, but that CMD sweetener is a wonderful thing to behold. His stats are perfectly balanced as a compromise between Voyages and Shuttle seats, and he excels in both. Should you be lacking some big names like Pollard, Rev Phlox, or Hobo Culber and lack that commanding presence then Eddy is a fine choice. 

The big BUT that never lies is that his event use is empty. Exobiology isn’t a friend to many event features, and although he shares the family name he won’t be cropping up on many of his son’s away missions. Combine that with a frequent roster of recurring SCI or MED crew potentially waiting in the wings, his voyage scores are bound to plummet. Great stats but be sure who else you have waiting on the cite list before you invest in Ed.
