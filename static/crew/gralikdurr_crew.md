Tom Dwan is probably going to hit a five spot in the Collections tab when it's all said and done, but already holding status as a multi-Collection piece is Durr's saving grace. With almost zero usefulness otherwise (stop sending in photos from the two Enterprise Mega Events. We know), his Beholds generally boil down to an equation of Collection count vs. Collection count.
