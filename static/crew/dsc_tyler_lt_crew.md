The megas just keep on comin’ - it seems that everything is coming up Tyler. Rocket fueled by six (!!!) previous megas, Tyler has fast become one of the most important event super rares the game has ever seen. While I wouldn’t bet on a Marksman or Tactician mega, I would have said the same for Pilot so, really, who knows? Beyond the clumps of Tyler/Disco events, he’s also one of only a few crew to offer the Pilot/SEC node unlock.
