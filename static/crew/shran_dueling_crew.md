With essentially no daily usability left in his Base or Proficiency numbers, cherish the moments when you do get to level/thaw Ushaan Shran for Events. We could see a ceiling of four Collections for this crew, which is a bonanza for one with only a quartet of Traits. And, oh yea, he makes a hell of a bridge crew photo op next to Ushaan Archer.
