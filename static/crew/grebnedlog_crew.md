One might expect the entry for this joke character to be nothing but silly references to his episode, but that would be stupid. And we are not stupid. We are smart.

Creepy Uncle Greb is a mishmash of useful and humorous. His ENG proficiency and arena ability are certainly referential to his role on-screen, but at the least the latter is fairly useful. While the ship battle speed up button may blur the lines between initialization times, faster is still better and Greb's big attack boost coming online at six seconds puts him in good stead with early-to-mid-game rosters.

Greb's bases are somewhat at odds with each other, however. A fittingly pitiful ENG score handicaps any voyage potential, leaving him in the tank alongside bottom barrel 3-skillers, while a pretty substantial DIP base makes him a possible surprise shuttle pilot when/if one of his obscure traits get called for event work. He's the #2 overall DIP option for Criminal and Thief while easily besting the other super rare Villains.

Noting specific ranks usually gets us in trouble for outdated notes down the line, but we want to be nothing if not persistent in highlighting the nice niche that Greb should be able to exploit sometime in the future.
