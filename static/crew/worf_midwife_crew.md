A somewhat backwards-looking crew, though not necessarily a poor one, Midworf debuted with iffy Voyage power even considering his great Skill set. By now he’s not really an option there and is only a stopgap choice on Ships, though he’ll perform fine as Ardra-lite for new players who may acquire several Stars of Worf at once.

Even his Collection potential seems tapped out at this point. Nevertheless, he’s still a fine snag for said Collections and his strong-for-MED Base should earn him weekend work in the future between various Worf weekends and Mega Events. It’s hard to see a world in which this crew sees an uptick in value, but he can coast on what he has for quite a while.
