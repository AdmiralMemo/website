McCoy had a hell of a run for a crew who entered right near the game’s launch. He made plenty of Voyages and even flirted with the Gauntlet for a while, but he’s all tapped out at this point.

If you need some really bad Bases for a few Events per year, Bones is your man. It’s possible that newer rosters may want him for Gauntlet help at a time where you’re desperate to snag those first few Exclusive drops and he might steal some wins in the top fifty while sporting 45% Crit. If that doesn’t sound like your roster, feel free to pass on an otherwise tempting Skill set.
