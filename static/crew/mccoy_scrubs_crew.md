For a card so old (Mid 2016), McCoy has held up remarkably well. DA has a rather flat stat distribution; sort of like a primary and two secondaries. For that reason, his MED is not noteworthy even if his work for MED/SEC voyages is. Four event features is unparalleled for non-mega golds, but although McCoy is a household name, he's not an event powerhouse and his #1 McCoy MED was just torpedoed by no less than two variants. Considering the universal lack of MED crew and such poor stats on the gauntlet focused ones, DA McCoy is a worthwhile pickup for most rosters with a bias toward early-to-mid game players.
