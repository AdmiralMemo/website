In the minisode that Craft hails from, Zora, the Discovery's computer gone all Blade Runner because it's been left parked in a nebula for a thousand years (don't ask), found him interesting enough to fall in love. If only this version of him were half as fascinating. If only he felt more . . . hand-crafted.

A top 10 CMD base is more of a punchline than anything else, given that in the past month, 3 other top 10 CMD bases have slid in ahead of him, serving only to make his Power Rangers codpiece look more like overcompensation rather than equal opportunity fan service. Amusingly, he does have the Crafty trait, but aside from that, his only real chance at relevance is Romantic, and frankly, I'm betting against that being of any use now that the crew pool is so large. Not a terrible crew to trip and fall into, but in a stone cold Behold, he's more of a Funny Face than he is a Gentleman Prefer Blondes.
