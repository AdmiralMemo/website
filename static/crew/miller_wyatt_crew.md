A Foreigner song come to life, Wyatt’s Take On Meaningful art is as integral to the plot as just about anything else in this power ballad episode and a welcome respite from the traditional Lwaxana nonsense.

Unfortunately, he’s not quite as radical on your roster. Without any daily use options, Miller is one of the best three Wyatts in the game and could find himself, at best, a triple Collection crew and a very occasional Event piece of those Traits catch a bonus.
