Oh boy, where do we begin with our favourite Commodore? Or general, or whatever she’s calling herself now . . . she snags a spot in two collections, and sports a +10 Arena attack at 8 seconds with no trigger. Unfortunately, those sunglasses can’t hide her common skill set, average voyage stats, and zer-Oh Gauntlet ability. Unless you’re chasing increased collection rewards, best to take a pass on her treacherous Tal Shiar ass.
