Historically, it has been very difficult to staff the “Romulan” Anti-matter seat on Voyages. Well, spoiler alert… Commodore Oh should not be the one to fill it for you.

“CMD and SEC” Shuttle seats litter Event histories going back years and Oh’s worthwhile power level there makes her a strong option when she snags a bonus or even on daily Shuttles. The problem is that WRG has not favored her Traits very much for Events and the likes of Zhat Vash and Tal Shiar may never see a bonus. A comparison can be made to certain base-heavy Sulus or Chekovs in that she will excel when given the chance, but you may have to wait a long time between chances.
