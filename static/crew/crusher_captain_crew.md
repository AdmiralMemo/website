Not your standard crew consideration; Bev is available in a specific place for a specific price. With Balok dethroning Kahless as the top CMD Gauntleteer, Bev pulls more equal with big K as one of two one-star Gauntlet options you can pick from in the Honor Hall. 

Crusher is more or less second fiddle in most Gauntlet corners; behind Exclusive Guinan or former Mega Event Legendary Lothario Q for MED/DIP and behind Defensive Phlox and a couple of Super Rares for single MED roll. She also doesn't have the tastiest Gauntlet crit Traits, registering single digit unique Gauntlets with elevated crit. Nevertheless, her hammerlock on the MED/CMD roll and respectable overall numbers make her a fine rotational piece - one you'd love to grab from, say, a Behold. 

Her value elsewhere is on the decline and accounts for much of the reason she's often passed over at her price point. Bev's Bases are frankly bad, as is expected from Gauntlet crew, but without a healthy Event clip to soften the blow, she's someone who might not make more than a single Shuttle Event per year, even with a high Fusion level.
