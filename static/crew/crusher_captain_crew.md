Not your standard crew consideration; Bev is available in a specific place for a specific price. Since her debut, she's remained firmly in Kahless' shadow. True, she doesn't measure up to him in most gauntlets, but few do. She's still quality crew and quibbles about her usually center around her cost. Four ranked gauntlet pairs, including a firm hold on the #1 MED/CMD combo, is a good place to start. But despite a top five MED proficiency, there are a few chinks in the armor. Her five traits don't collect crit bonuses quite as often as some gauntleteers and the MED ranks are overrun by more accessible super rare crew. She'll do fine as one of your gauntlet five, but don't expect her to be head and shoulders above her peers.

Her value elsewhere is on the decline and accounts for much of the reason she's often passed over at her price point. Bev's bases are frankly bad, as is expected from gauntlet crew, but without a healthy event clip to soften the blow, she's someone who might not make more than a single shuttle event per year, even with plenty of stars. Voyages are the other place you'd likely employ her. She's fine there (with honor investment) and retains an uncommon MED/CMD skill pairing and MED primary; neither of which are particularly easy to come by. Chasing the treadmill of rankings is understandable, but Bev's great skill set and chunk of proficiency keeps her status as a useful crew member in the face of slipping base and voyage power.
