Whether blanket bonus Disco megas are done or not, the Fonzie card art is the best thing about Rejac. He's unlikely to contribute day to day without several stars and his event opportunities look to be few and far between from here on out. Klingon and Disco have combined for huge swaths of bonuses already, inflating an event clip that is sure to slow. A formerly ranked gauntlet pair with the occasional 65% crit might rarely make him a fifth member of your gauntlet squad, but that's rarely worth spending your behold capital on.
