The Fonzie card art is the best thing about Rejac. Strikingly similar to his brother-in-arms Tâ€™Kuvma, Rejac (rejac, Rejac, REJAC) is a part-time Gauntlet crew in the early game thanks to strong Crit values, a shuttle stuffer thanks to the preponderance of CMD/SEC seats in Events, and a Collection piece. His Trait footprint outstripes his brief role on screen, even making him a justifiable Crew Retrieval option for veteran players who only have eyes for Collections.
