Chapel had a nice peak some time after release which saw her with reasonable Voyage ability and a pair of Collections before most other crew could claim that accomplishment. Now, years later, those Collections are all that remain.

While Physician and Veteran remain viable Mega Event Traits, her Bases may not provide a ton of help during those periods anyways. Weâ€™re grateful to have seen the much ballyhooed Leo da Vinci Event Re-run come to fruition which saw her as a big bonus Featured name and even provided us with a reasonable second Legendary crew in Korby. That might be her only path to actual use on the majority of rosters.
