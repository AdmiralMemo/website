The Killing Game is a classic Voyager episode and Colonel Karr is a key character in it, this however isn't Karr but why let that get in the way? 

Ok, so let's take a breath and get past the fact that the art is in fact Turanj (Karr's beta) and look at the card itself. Even when his 65% gauntlet hits, the chances are you'll have better options but he could have possible use there on a younger roster especially with his top ten super rare CMD roll. With poor bases and little else going for him the main reason you're going to want to get and freeze Turanj, I mean Karr, is for his three stat boosting collections with potentially two more down the road.
