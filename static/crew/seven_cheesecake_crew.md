Perverting science and technology never felt so right. Fusion, hybrid, abomination - whatever you want to call these experiments by DB, this one, at least, doesn't disappoint. There are several talking points here, but let's start with Seven's pristine skill order which she only shares with the less powerful Torpedo McCoy. In combination with a strong stat total (and voyage MED), she's among the most impactful voyagers in the game whose value above replacement blows past CMD/SEC also-rans with similar overall numbers.

Equally as mouth-watering is event eligibility to rival the fabled Zhian'tara Odo. Triggering bonuses for Doc, Seven, and Borg events, the trait and variant mish mash has given her a minimum of four events in each of the last three years. Without getting too TV spoilery, I'd bet my Big Book licence that those numbers will continue (or improve!) in the future. Coupled with easily the best MED of the bunch and usable SCI, she's guaranteed to add big, fat success numbers to Faction shuttles that will fail at 99% anyways.

We'll take the downsides (gauntlet, arena) in stride, as her power/usefulness combo in other areas is simply outstanding. If you can find a Mobile Doc between the couch cushions, upgrade him to this version and flip on the telly to watch Patrick Stewart and company Fridays on UPN!
