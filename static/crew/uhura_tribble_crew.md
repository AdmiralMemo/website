ðŸŽµ Oh, on the starship Enterprise, Uhura's skill sets make us cry. The devs all fear that if we're wise, we'll ask for rarer crew. 

At first, her art could hypnotize but then blandness will agonize. Her collection could victimize and rip your cites from you. 

And that's why female astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts wait terrified and overwrought to find what WRG will do. 

Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary, girls in space, be wary. We know not what WRG will do. 

Now from a Mega Event place, she comes with variant-best base. A-seeking out her Faction place, she fills Shuttles for you. 

Oh, Tribble's our new darling, our darling, our darling. Tribble's our new darling. We know how well she'll do. ðŸŽµ

Song aside, Tribble Uhura was one of a triplet of Uhurae released around the same time with identical triplets and Voyage power (along with Rescue Team and Lt. Commander versions).  She is unlikely to contribute to Voyages for a mid or endgame player, and her Trait set is thinnish, but you may want to prioritize her for the needed slot in the Tribbled Collection, as nearly every crew is needed to complete it.
