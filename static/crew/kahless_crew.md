When I started playing Timelines, I had one goal: gather enough resources to buy Kahless before he left the Honor Hall. The chase was worth it for me and most players tend to agree. In the gauntlet, he owns the #1 CMD proficiency and still has a lock on a #1 gauntlet pair, though crit numbers may fudge the math from time to time. Thankfully, Kahless can bring plenty of crit strength to bear as well with occasional 65% gauntlets. Power creep and lizards are the only things that travel faster than warp 10, so it's remarkable that this three year old remains as useful as he is.

Having sat on both sides of the citation argument (and even on the fence itself), I've settled quite firmly into the do-not-cite crowd. His skill set is reason enough in most cases, but the voyage metrics across the board simply don't justify the minimum spend of 200,000 honor, considering thin weekend usability for his below average bases. Many players have choked on the price for his first star and the longer that Timelines carries on, the harder it is to say he's definitively a good investment, more so that he has been. Who would have thought a non-event, CMD/DIP/SEC crew would have aged as well as he has? In either case, he remains a wonderfully valuable choice; another option for your honor.
