The age old and fittingly Honorable question; is Kahless worth his price tag? The investment was worth it for this author and for purposes of gauntlet, many players tend to agree. In the gauntlet, he owns the #1 CMD proficiency and still has a lock on a #1 gauntlet pair (four ranked pairs), though crit numbers may fudge the math from time to time. Thankfully, Kahless can bring plenty of crit strength to bear as well with six different sets at 45% or better. Power creep and lizards are the only things that travel faster than warp 10, so it's remarkable that this four year old card remains as useful as he is.

The next question is should I cite? The answer will depend on who you ask, but as it stands he's a top 100 voyager with a spot in a massive collection that currently would require you to finish far worse legendary crew than big K. In either case, he remains a wonderfully valuable choice; another option for your honor.
