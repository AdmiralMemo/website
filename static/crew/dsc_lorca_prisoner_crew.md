We knew that a post-Discovery Mega Event life would be a rough one, even for a guy in prison, but Lorca has done alright for himself since then. His Trait list has provided a handful of Event bonuses and even though some of them such as Desperate or Tactician are fairly large, they should still be eligible for Collections if Resourceful is anything to go by.

We don't want to oversell how often you might use Lorca, but considering he's a years-old Super Rare 2-Skiller, one can at least see a path to value thanks to his Shuttle friendly Skill pair and handful of Traits.
