Tactical MACO Mayweather... quite the mouthful to say. But we call this crew Taco Mayweather for the nifty "combo plate" of qualities he brings to bear.

Combo item #1: a "big burrito" of a Ship Battle ability that compares favorably with Garth of Izar's; Taco adds +1 Attack and no use limit, albeit with 2 fewer seconds of duration. Combo item #2: Solid prospects in the Gauntlet, with "taco trios" of 45% and 25% bonuses. He's also in the "Smoke and Mirrors" collection which is our combo item #3, or a nice garnish if you will.

It's true that he's no great Voyager, and his Event futures appear skimpy. But Taco looks pretty tasty on every other front. To paraphrase some sage advice, "his packs aren't worth chasing, but you'd gladly pick him up in a BeGold or Crew Retrieval".
