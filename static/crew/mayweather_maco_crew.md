If you’re coming here because TACO Mayweather is in your Legendary Behold, read this first paragraph first (bold of me to assume you’d read top to bottom, right?)! Travis finally getting some daily use love comes years after his inauspicious debut as the 1000th-ish crew in the game comes from his use in Fleet Boss Battles. One of the premiere attack crew in the current meta, TACO has a +9 Attack Boost, 400% Instant Damage Ability with no Limit on use, and a 16s Cycle time to allow you to hit the Doomsday Machine again and again and again, coupled with your Hull Repair crew and a Crit Bonus crew like Vox or Demo Man Scotty. He’s also pretty expensive in Crew Retrieval, with few avenues to a 100% success rate and expensive Polestars in terms of ISM. So, consider picking him up from your Legendary Behold!

Outside of FBB, Travis is a zero on Voyages by now, but he’s got a little bit of juice in the Gauntlet with a handful of 45% or 65% Crit sets, and almost a score of 25% sets to make him a fun inclusion, or useful in the early game until you Retrieve better options in the Time Portal, or luck into Gauntlet Exclusives. 

His CMD/DIP/SUCK Skill set also gives him utility on Event shuttles; while Travis is not a stellar Event name, his ancillary Traits have provided a solid number of weekend bonuses. Those same Traits give him an average Collection profile with room to grow, so as you Fuse him up to take full advantage of his +9 Attack Boost, you’ll also stack some Collection tick marks.
