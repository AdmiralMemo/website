From 'Bread and Circuses' comes an old man with a sword as one of the most deadly beings in the known universe (this joke played better when he was a top ten Base. Please laugh). McCoy's SEC is obviously stellar for a MED-focused character and may be so for a long time. He'll lose MED seating to the man who practiced one kick 10,000 times, global gift Bones McCoy, but he's the master of his SEC domain.

Beyond Shuttles, his uncommon Skill pairing translates to plus utility in the appropriately thematic form of the Gauntlet. Yes he's a 2-Skiller, but walls of MED/SEC are very rare and there are always 2-for-1s or weaker options to attack, spelling out good things for McCoy both offensively and defensively when he enters the Gladiator's arena in one of his almost thirty elevated Crit Gauntlets. That's as good of a sell job as we can do for a 2-Skill Gauntlet option - hopefully he does well for your new roster or as a rare 5th for long time players.

Toss in some Collection value stemming from a fun Trait set and Glad is one of the most well-rounded 2-Skill crew in the game 'and I'm tired of pretending he's not'.
