LaBorg is in danger of becoming one of those crew whose reputation exceeds his grasp. Granted, we at the Big Book are partly responsible for that; players have had almost three years to talk up what has been an excellent crew and a mainstay in several areas of the game. Triple collections, triple ranked gauntlet pairs (with 65% crit capability), and double dipping La Forge and Borg events is an embarrasment of riches.

Just be sure to mentally course correct his voyage score as sub-100 and an ENG base now in the thirties. Still well-rounded and with oodles of value to offer a new player after the heroic achievement of honoring his build cost, but with much less power relative to the field these days.
