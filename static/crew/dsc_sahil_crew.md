Our shamelessly pilfered lead-in is as follows: He never leaves his desk, of course he can't possibly have a good voyage score. Thank you, guy in the chat.

Sahil has a ~1500 CMD base to his name, but so did three of the four event crew prior to his release. In fact, WRG has done a strong job of consistently stuffing that particular stocking all year 'round, with a big CMD primary available in almost every month over the last fifteen. His dud of a trait set (Ambassador.....................maybe) combined with disappearing Disco bonuses may leave him shuffling papers on his desk if you have any comparable bases with better utility on your roster.

Thus concludes the highlights portion of the evening. Frankly gross debut voyage numbers meet an all too available skill set to render him a psuedo-2-skiller unless you make him a day one citation target and are okay with getting no more than a year of voyage use from him.

A strong arena evasion component is available, but can be easily bettered until Sahil is FF and even then, may not last long enough to adequately protect your Ferengi garbage scow. In a year's time when crew slots are tight and he's looking like prime airlock material, you have the Big Book stamp of approval to say 'Sahil you later'.
