Having not walked across a hallway yet at this point in Discovery, Sahil is naturally bereft of power and interesting attributes. Aside from reasonable Evasion on Ships, the only usability here, if you squint hard enough, is a CMD Base ranked somewhere in double digits for use in the 2023 Ambassador Mega Event (I'm going to look like a bloody genius if this hits).

As a notch in the two Collections and possibly one or two more down the line, Sahil barely qualifies as a “last call” type of Behold option, but if you missed his Campaign and are doing the slow Fuse via Beholds, his Shuttle potential should be dried up by the time you Immortalize him.
