Much like the White Rose Redi-Tea she's stirring up, Kay won't be to everyone's palate, whether you're a self-respecting Englishman or simply tired of this skillset. With no less than three previous megas sharing the same set, chances are, even if you haven't been chasing it, it's not something you're worrying about. Poor traits and the conspicuous absence of the Bajoran tag - consistent with Benny Russell, but still disappointing - mean that you're essentially waiting for events for her dance card to get any play.

That being said, as a Kira event piece, she does immediately carve out a unique space as her only SCI variant, which could well pay dividends in the future, and if you happened to miss some recent mega crew, she'll shore up any deficiences you have there. You do, after all, need to fill multiple seats for these skills, and there's nothing wrong with strengthening what you already have - you can't always plug your roster holes, especially since some of them are designed that way (looking at you, MED/CMD).

In the end, appropriately for such a forward looking character, you're investing in future spoils with this card, not immediate gratification. Depending on your playstyle, that either makes her an investment sink, or a source of incredible satisfaction six to twelve months down the line.
