Kay Eaton’s debut Voyage score wasn’t great to begin with, but shoving out of spacedock wearing the CMD/DIP/SCI skill set is begging for Power Creep™ to do its dirty deed unless you’re rocking some major power notes.

Remarkably consistent with variant Events over the years, Kay will be a fine plug-n-play weekend Shuttle pilot, even if her Events are thick with CMD/DIP/SEC seating.

Settling for Events and Collections to hang her hat on like many crew much older than her, Kay dropped from daily use faster than a lot of options her age, but should settle into a part time role nicely with at least one or two niches to exploit.
