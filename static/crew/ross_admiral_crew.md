Despite being a fan favorite among Starfleet admirals, Ross doesn't have terribly much depth as a card. By the way, if you're looking for the Gauntlet-y one, that's Admiral Owen Paris. I know, I mix them up too. 

Ross' event work is on a break, but a good PIVOT, PIVOT to choose him in a Super Rare Behold should you see him pop up and you like an above average set of three Collections. That’s all he’s getting though, don’t monkey around.
