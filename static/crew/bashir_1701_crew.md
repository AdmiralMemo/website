Lieutenant Watley was checking out Bashir's open flap on this card's release, but his haircut stolen from your dad's 1970's college photo is starting to win out.

A handful of Collections with a little room for expansion is all we need to say to get veteran players to bite. Even though Bashir variants are loaded with MED and it's a tricky Skill to find enough seating for in a Faction Event, 1701 Bashir is a fine late game grab on the back of his Trait potential and he should drift in the middle tiers for quite a while.
