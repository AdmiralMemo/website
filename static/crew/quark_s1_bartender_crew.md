Thanks to the addition of the Gambler Collection, Quarkâ€™s usefulness is at an all-time high. Young rosters (and Nightmare Mode players) will love his Shuttle and Voyage metrics, but like all Common crew these are easily outclassed by higher rarity options as time goes on. Requiring a couple handfuls of faction items to Immortalize, he may be a bit expensive early on, but keep an open mind whenever you see him show up!
