In the Collection/Trait era, Sloan is looking marginally better than he had previously. Still not a daily use option aside from a reasonable Crit-centric Ship Ability, heâ€™ll be banking on any one of his quartet of viable Traits to grant Collection value. Events are of course on the table, but most well-stocked rosters would find little use in thawing his mid-2017 Bases.
