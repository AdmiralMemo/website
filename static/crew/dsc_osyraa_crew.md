If you are in the market for a thinly-Traited Legendary Orion with an overstuffed Skill set and no Voyage power to back it up, you've come to the right place. There's some very thin value on the periphery in the form of untapped Traits and a 65% gauntlet, but if you're looking into Osyrra, it's generally because she debuted with competent Voyage power in Q2 2021 or because you have a star floating around on your roster and forgot where it came from. 

She owns a few metrics that don't look terrible, but like a true Orion woman, it's an illusion. Barring an improvement to the relevancy of her Traits, try to avoid adding stars except against truly awful Behold choices. Thankfully, with Dâ€™Vana Tendi in Lower Decks giving us more fun Orion variants via the Lower Decks series, you can hopefully avoid having to fully fuse Osyraa to finish her racial Collection.
