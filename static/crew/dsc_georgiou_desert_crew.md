Georgy girl holds the distinction of being one of only two legendary crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections. That used to carry much more weight, but with none of them requiring Goldmembers any longer, it's more of a behold screen perk if she's collected a few stars already.

The bulk of her value now rests on Discovery and variant events, of which there have been plenty. Even considering a trait set mostly bereft of value, Georgiou has collected multiple Faction events in each of the last three calendar years including TEN event bonuses in 2019.
