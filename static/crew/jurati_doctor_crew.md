With a huge gap between raw Voyage power and real world Voyage utility, Jurati is a crew that new players would love to get their hands on. A strong Skill set and seven Antimatter Traits will have her making runs for you into the midgame and are a breath of fresh air in the face of so many monotonous skill sets. If your young roster can manage to snag multiple copies in quick succession, she will perform for you in that area.

Everything else, however, is merely garnish. Multiple Collections are always nice to snag on a single crew, just keep in mind that hundreds of Super Rares have already achieved that mark and her overall ceiling in that area remains average. A strong on-paper MED Base rank is undercut by atrociously low chances for MED seating in many Events. Jurati is a fine crew on balance, but one thatâ€™s primarily pointed at the early game and without as much flexibility or longevity as some others.
