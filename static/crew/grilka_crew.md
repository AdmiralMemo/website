Grilka almost makes me feel bad for Quark - I wouldn't even let her on my ship. The only thing of note about her is the #7 Klingon DIP base, whatever that's worth, and if you're really in love with the card, then cross your fingers that mid-2020's standalone Romantic event was somehow a portent of things to come, rather than a slightly awkward throwback.
