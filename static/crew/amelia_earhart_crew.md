Hailing from an all-time bad episode of Trek is one way to be remembered. Another is to debut with some serious in-game power. Years after her release, Amelia is still rockin' it in almost every area of the game. A serviceable Base and fistful of Event-able Traits are the chocolate and peanut butter of Timelines combos and that simmering Trait list could and should improve her track record there as well as in the Collections tab. Before long, weâ€™d fully expect her Collection value to soar to a height of up to six.

Somewhat underrated is her Gauntlet ability. True, Red Angel and Balok will take their turns smashing her, but a fistful of elevated Crit Gauntlets will make her a fine inclusion once in a while, especially if you don't have the best luck getting the Gauntlet Exclusive Crew to drop.
