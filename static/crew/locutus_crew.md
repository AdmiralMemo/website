It's absolutely incredible that this two year old card is still as effective as he is. Let's start at the collections tab, where he's nearly peerless. An early 2019 server push pushed Locutus into rarefied air as one of three crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections, including the exclusive percent-per-crew Gauntlet group. The raw voyage numbers are still strong, and while a DIP/SEC set may not seem impressive, he joins the Xindi Bug as the only crew with his skill set in the top 50 voyagers.

His wheelhouse remains the gauntlet where only he and The Red Angel own two #1 ranked skill pairings (four overall). A massive DIP proficiency is the best single roll in the game and often boosted by a half dozen frequently seen crit traits. His unique arena ability (1 second attack) can allow some skirmish shenanigans with fast-activating damage crew and shave a lot of time off your weekends.

The elephant in the room is clearly a set of poor bases. Though not at Gowron levels of disgusting, they're bad enough to be mistaken for a super rare, even at 5/5. His opportunities are fairly frequent thanks to Picard and Borg weekends (#2 Borg DIP) which are due for an uptick in 2020, but he'll perform noticeably behind the top ranked crew and has more variant competition than any other character. Thanks to his uniqueness in several areas including collections and the arena, he's arguably the most well-rounded crew in the game.
