Turn your head and cough' jokes and All Red Everything bridge crew photos are the upper limit for Pulaski. Once coveted, kinda, for her huge MED Base, this is no longer a plus. With that Skill seating so scarce in Faction Events and Pulaski rarely catching a bonus...I'm afraid I've got some bad news, Doctor.

Kathy's lone 45% Gauntlet and reasonable MED/SCI Proficiency pair might make the cut for fledgling rosters and she does have *a* viable Trait, leading to most Behold selectors muttering, "At least she's a Physician". We've sounded caution on this crew for a long time due to her self-apparent trajectory and she hasn't deviated from it. Only choose this card if the other Behold options are Portal 63 and Cadet Sylvia Tilly.
