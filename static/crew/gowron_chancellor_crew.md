For a single star, not many crew can pack a punch like Ol' Crazy Eyes. Outside of the gauntlet, Gowron's numbers are an embarassment, but inside the cage, he's quite the mauler. Owning the #2 DIP proficiency and DIP/SEC pair along with a few 45% trait sets is formidable ammunition, no matter how well developed your starting five is. He's far better than his peers at 1/5, but additional stars are a downright foolish investment unless you have the begolds to waste. 🐋
