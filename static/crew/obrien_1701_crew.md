The confused look on O’Brien’s face is probably him wondering if he’s seen his stats somewhere before. Who remembers Augment Command O’Brien, you do? Excellent, what if we took out all of Augment's useful proficiencies and gauntlet bonuses and replaced them with more power. Sounds good right? Wrong.
It does seem that this rehash of a 2018 crew lacks a few things missing from the original. Whilst Augment is showing his age this is probably not the way to go about it. His bases are strong and he sits high enough in the shuttle pair listings to probably be of use down the line when his number is called. However when it comes to expendable crew this variant of O’Brien must strongly be regretting the red shirt he wears. Grab him if you need to bolster your SEC/ENG ranks but consider someone with a third skill or more utility as an alternative.
