Middling is the word of the day - there are a few perks here, just enough for her behold appearance to elicit an "Oh..."

Her voyage power is just Oh-K for most skill sets, but fairly dire for the ubiquitous CMD/DIP/SEC. She can make runs for most rosters, just not for too much longer. Nevertheless, it's her other offerings you're likely after.

Double collections - one of which still requires legendary crew - and a little event potential, both from traits and a possible all-inclusive Picard mega. She even collects a handful of 45% gauntlet sets, but doesn't break into the power charts for any of them, again, because of a lousy skill set.

The buried lede here is a great arena ability - think everybody's favorite Killy, just a hair slower. If one hand on the hip isn't enough and you just have to pivot to an option with both hands firmly in power pose, Oh will do a fine approximation, right down to the beefy +10 attack boost with five stars. You might have to tap for a few more minutes over the course of a skirmish weekend or be picky with your arena victims, but the gulf in effectiveness between Oh and the top options is not massive.
