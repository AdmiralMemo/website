Generally fair-to-bad in most areas, it’s General Oh’s work on Ships that’s of most interest. “Killy, but two seconds slower” is blasphemous for veteran players and may have them vomiting and rending their garments, but for players who don’t have perfectly manicured ship lineups or have bigger fish to fry with their Crew Retrievals, Oh does a fair enough approximation to last you a long time.

If you are that fresh faced Timelines cadet, keep an eye out for any of her 45% Gauntlet sets. She doesn’t have the Proficiency power to last past your first year in the game, but a reasonable CMD Roll can handle mop-up duty on thinner rosters.

And not to beat a dead Targ, but a crew this old without a lot of daily use is reduced to the sum of their Trait list. We can’t picture a world in which Zhat Vash and Tal Shiar hit Collections, but even without them, a Collection ceiling of four with three in hand is better than average.
