Itchy's surface level numbers weren't great on release and thus he's aged faster than the sort of crew you'd feel good about investing in. No longer viable as a Voyager, he at least offers a smattering of Event and Collection possibilities with mid-range value.

Strong Evasion on Ships is another blip of utility if you take Icheb to max for his time-travel-done-right episode or if you're anticipating a killer bridge crew photo alongside Adult Wesley in the future.
