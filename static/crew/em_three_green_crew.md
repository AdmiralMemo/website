Finally, the TAS card weâ€™ve all been waiting for. Em/3/Green? Green is a cowardly thief and lock picker from The Animated Series. 
 
Their sole use on most rosters  is +1 to the jury rigger collection. Once the hardest stat-boosting collection to complete, Spit and Bailing Wire no longer requires any legendaries or even all super rares to complete. 

A lack of events means that Green has no staying power on mid to late game rosters. Just freeze and forget.
