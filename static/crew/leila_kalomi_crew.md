Leila's superb art may have us on our knees, but her numbers may not ease our worried minds (or precious crew slots) for long.

A splash of MED never hurts any crew, and Leila has a respectable place in the SCI/DIP ranks with traits that hit a fair number of voyage (if not event) bonuses, though she is surrounded by former mega crew and giveaways that many players will have on their rosters at 3/5 or better already.

Her overall stats paint a picture of a crew that is just far enough on the side of good to be useful were you to get her fused up immediately, but they come with a red flag. As we have seen time and time again, crew that debut this low in the ranks tend to have a shorter useful shelf life when they don't have Event, Arena, or Gauntlet usage to fall back on, and unfortunately Leila comes up short on all three.

For a one-off crew, you could do much, much worse, just realize that long-term she profiles more as an occasional use crew than a daily use one.
