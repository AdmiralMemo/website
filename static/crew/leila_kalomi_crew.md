Leila's superb art may have us on our knees, but her numbers may not ease our worried minds (or precious crew slots) for long.

Space-age overalls aside, Leila has a zero for Voyages, Gauntlet, and for Ship Battles, but now that Paradise Spock has arrived you can put them on your Bridge together.

Her saving grace moving forward is likely to be a Trait list that has begun to slowly blossom into value for Collections. Given WRGâ€™s widely gyrating Collection sizes from Botanist to Brutal, any of her Traits could be in play and could give her anywhere from two to five before WRG Ben breathes his last.

For a one-off crew, you could do much worse, just realize that long-term she profiles as a card prone to continue her extended stretches of irrelevance.
