Cite her? Probably, yea. She projects to retain her double-digit voyage rank status a year after release, during which she'll probably have collected another handful of event bonuses.

The easy voyage comp for Braids Burnham is Mirror Jean-Luc Picard, performing very similarly to him there while going base heavy instead of contributing in the gauntlet. Which is fine, as Burnham is the Discovery poster child, while also popping up in Timelines everywhere from Gauntlet exclusive to, well, recurring mega crew.

There's not much versatility here in other areas of the game or in a deceptively thin trait set for event bonuses, which may hamstring her reach as the card ages. But as a day one acquisition, particularly at four stars, she's a fine addition to any roster and will pull her weight.
