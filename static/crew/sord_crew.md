I’ll take S-words for $400, Trebeck. We know that the TAS writers had enjoyed a few Potent Potables before Sord’s episode, but WRG still decided to make him a worthwhile crew. Sord’s Voyage ability is gone, so we need to turn to his Ship Ability and Trait list for value.

One of the game’s premier Shipboard options has flown under the radar for too long, but his uncommon Instant Damage/Accuracy pairing comes online in no time and can be tougher to replace than any of the Attack-Boosting Instant Damage options floating around out there. With tempting Collection value as another reason to stack stars, Sord is a fine Legendary Behold, Crew Retrieval (and Immortalization) target, even if he’s not providing you with traditional, top-notch Voyage and Shuttle value.
