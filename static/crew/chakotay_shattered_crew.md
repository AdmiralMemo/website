TPC's situation has done a 180 recently; despite a pristine skill set, crew additions in 2019 have beaten up on his voyage usefulness, particularly SEC/ENG. But after a two year drought, his events have picked back up and as the only legendary Chakotay variant, he can still dominate event work. A rare skill set and uptick in events help him continue to garner work even in the face of drooping stat ranks.
