Having dropped a chunk of daily usability from his overall profile, Fugitive Spock can still boast a simply absurd Event history. Even discounting Discovery Mega Events going forward, Spock’s down years are better than a lot of cards’ career years and his Base is still worth the thaw for almost all of them.

Like most Spocks, Fugitive also has a proper Trait list (which his Event list can testify to) to all but guarantee average or better Collection value in any given month, and his long term value dominates the headlines.
