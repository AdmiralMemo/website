This particular variant was previously featured crew for a Galaxy Event with many players lamenting how awful she was with a 10x bonus and some saying that they didn’t even use her. That was her absolute best case scenario. Luckily, her Trait list hit with her maximum of two Collections, so that’s the literal only reason you should work on this crew. Sorry, Nichelle.
