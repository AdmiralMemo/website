Treat your post boxes well, folks, or they will get angry. And thanks to your subscription to Miniature Donkey Talk Magazine, they know where you live.

As of this writing, Robot's sole redeeming quality is a spot in the classic black & white Vanity Collection. The good news is he still has three Traits that can play for Collections and Events, the bad news is that they barely have to date. Although it's likely that one or more will have hit by the time you're reading this, his ceiling is certainly limited and any semblance of daily use is not in the cards.
