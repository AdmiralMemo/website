In your Rare Crew you want Cadet Mission eligibility, and T’Pol can pitch in on both days of the weekend to help you Crit those Nodes so you can open up Warp. Her Big SCI Base (although with a disappointing Proficiency) will work wonders, and once you’ve Immortalized her, you’ll be glad you did with two Stat-boosting Collections, and Traits for one or two more.
