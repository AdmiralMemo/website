A fugitive from Easter Island, this encephalitic enigma shows up in a few areas off the beaten path from your traditional Behold options.

Gauntlet is generally Keeper's headline. Worthwhile overall Proficiency and laughably small CMD roll seem at odds, but his top two pairs of SCI/MED and SCI/CMD rarely face walls of overpowered Exclusive crew and he has a handful of 45% Gauntlets that will have opponents thinking twice about attacking into you. Obviously Keeper's chances to ride in your Fave Five diminish as your roster grows, but he's a capable inclusion at almost any player level.

Those some Crit-enabling Traits make for a tantalizing lineup of Collection potential. Since WRG has included Collections of any size since their monthly releases began years ago, anything from Telepath to Quantum Mechanics is in play, meaning a ceiling of seven Collections is not far-fetched.
