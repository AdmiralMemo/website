Voyages are the name of the game where, despite ranking sub-100, Rogers' excels thanks to her tasty skill set. If you add stars to her by any means, it's almost always to help boost your ENG/MED voyage runs which sit at the bottom of everybody's list. Thin utility elsewhere includes a sketchy trait set for future event work and strong arena EV at six seconds which, like her time on screen, you may wish lasted a bit longer.
