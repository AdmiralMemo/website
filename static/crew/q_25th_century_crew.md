You can almost hear de Lancie exclaiming, “How ‘bout a big hug!” It might be best to save your hugs for more worthy crew.

The areas of interest here are the standard Event/Collection combo that just about every Legendary in the game has at this point. Without many goodies in his Gauntlet, Voyage, or Ship baskets, it’s mostly a mishmash of variant and Trait Events a few times per year to look forward to.

Given you could get him 80% Fully Fused due to his debut in a Time Portal Giveaway/Endurance Objective Event, it makes this Q a tempting Legendary Citation target, but he offers nothing that other crew couldn’t match and his mostly subpar daily offerings are a disappointment.
