The lesser half of the Voyager stage play Resolutions has made her way to the game. And while we wait for Bathtub, Man's Man Chakotay to join her (hopefully forever, in placid paradise), feel free to collect three copies of Janeway for mere peanuts.

Sitting atop a mountain of thirteen Janeway variants with SCI should ensure evergreen Faction opportunities for Homesteader, which is truer for her character than any other, as Janeway boasts a 92% Faction rate for her events. Contributing the only MED skill among variants gives her another shuttle market to corner too.

Without much fringe value, aside from arena evasion just fast enough to get you killed, voyages are the other area of competency for this landlubber. Despite two recurring mega crew who share her skill set appearing over the past year, SCI/MED remains on the rare side overall. An average-for-new-crew power level and plus skill set won't make her an ageless voyage anchor like some crew, but do help make her a fine investment if you also want to be able to use her years from now with a big shuttle bonus score.

A close comparison to Seeking Spock, these types of crew aren't necessarily chart toppers, but have strong present day use while offering a reliable event cushion to soften the aging blow.
