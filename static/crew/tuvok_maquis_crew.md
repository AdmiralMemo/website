The prior version of this note referenced a dearth of great Legendary Tuvoks, and lo and behold Mirror Tuvok entered the Faction Store. What does this have to do with decrepit ol’ Maquis Tuvok? Nothing, really.

MaqVok does have a pretty quality list of Traits. They’ve provided the bulk of this variant’s Event chances as well as some Collection, and should the rest of his Trait lineup awaken, his value could be on the upswing as a solid Behold or Crew Retrieval choice, but until then, he may be a “choice of last resort” when he pops up in a trio of options.
