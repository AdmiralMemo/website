Mugato is quite literally a meme card (inspiring Will Ferrellâ€™s Zoolander villain) and probably not the name you want to chase if you need Collection help. WRG was at least good enough to give him competitive Proficiencies which could be formidable if he was able to leverage better than 25% Crit. As it stands, use him to beat up on Balok once in a while and have a laugh.
