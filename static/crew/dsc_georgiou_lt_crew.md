"Armed Philippa Georgiou but slightly better" is the best way to describe this card. Not that that's a bad thing; Lt. PG has the exact same traits including dual collections, the same event eligibility not only as disco but as main cast, the same DIP primary (but slightly better...), you get the idea. She even brings DIP/CMD/SCI, the second most common skill set in the game, in place of Armed's redundant skill set of redundancy.

She probably won't last long on voyages without getting replaced by the likes of Shadowy Bastard or some other mega recurring, but she'll be in and out of the freezer for the foreseeable future. Now why is the doublemint gum jingle stuck in my head?
