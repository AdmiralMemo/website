There are certain cards that you just know have peaked in value. No untapped Collection traits, inflated Event tally from a bygone tsunami of show Mega Events - Not every card needs to have avenues to appreciate in value over time, but it sure as hell helps.

Exhibit A: Lt. Georgiou’s 2020/21 Event history. Everyone should have seen that one coming, so even though she has pretty strong Shuttle metrics, her thawpertunities will likely be few and far between.

Exhibit B: Georgiou has hit her Collection ceiling at three, even cashing in on a show-based Collection no one saw coming. This is about average for a Super Rare crew at this time, but gets worse in comparison every month.

Again, her offerings as they stand are “good enough” to merit the Behold choice in some cases, but as long as we’re playing in the eye of the Collection hurricane, it can’t hurt to snag some more Trait-rich crew or names that you can use right out of the box on a daily (or weekly) basis when possible.
