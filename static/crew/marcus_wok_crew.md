Marcus’ usage is too narrow to justify spending valuable early game resources and she profiles more as a midgame leveling project to help you stack collection boosts. While we can’t always choose our crew early on, merit diving for any number of dual-eligible options such as Saavik or Mara should help sate your SCI and CMD needs.
