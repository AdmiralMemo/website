Princess Bride joke. Three Event features is about as good as it gets for Legendary crew, even if you'd just be using Zek to star up a poor card. He's also collected a respectable Event tally in the meantime, even without the benefit of a Ferengi Mega Event - behold the power of Traits. Princess Bride joke.

Zek's half dozen Traits with nary a Human, Federation, or Starfleet among them is top shelf collection material and he has as good a chance as any card to run the infinity gauntlet gamut and hold a fistful of Collections before WRG's Trait push is all said and done. Princess Bride joke that ties the note together.
