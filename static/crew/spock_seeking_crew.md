Giant Intergalactic Space Probes Seeking Spock is not a section I expected to find in the newspaper but here we are! Spock has a decently high SCI stat to score him #10 in the rankings which also makes him the second best SCI Spock behind Science Officer. His combined SCI/MED scores give him a nice boost in voyages just behind Indulgant Seven and his Voyage rank, although not as strong as some, is respectable enough to earn him a place on your outgoing excursions. Combine all that with the fact he is Spock, a name bound to gain plenty of event usage in the future! Now back to the paper, ooh Tellerites Seeking Zakdorn!
