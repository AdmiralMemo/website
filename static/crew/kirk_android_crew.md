Let's consider the cards that Timelines could have given us from "What Are Little Girl's Made Of". Andrea? Nope. Roger Corby? What are we thinking! Kirk holding the iconic Ruk in what is a memorable image from The Original Series? Don't be daft. No it's regular vanilla kirk, but he's an android inside! God forbid I attempt to get my wallet out for this one...

Regardless of a boring appearance, Kirk does boast a few notables. He dethrones Desert T'Pol for the top SEC/SCI voyage pair and comes in quite high in the overall rankings. And Kirk's elite, well documented event history meets a few off-brand traits to hopefully spike month-long weekend appearances. Like his namesake, not the most inspirational card on your roster, but certainly not without uses.
