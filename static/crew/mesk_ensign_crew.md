As so eloquently described on a recent Big Book Podcast (check it out!), Mesk is the Orion Worf; he cosplays as an ideal, stereotypical Orion, but he really isn’t one. As far as this Super Rare crew card, he is neatly packaged into an Event Threshold Reward during the latest Animated Mega Event, and he’s got what you want out of a crew of his Rarity: a small handful of Collections, an untapped Trait or two for later, and as a bonus here, a slot in the very niche Alluring Pheromones Collection, meaning you don’t have to Immortalize one of the “Bound” Girls or Orion Vina, very old and decrepit Legendary cards which require a lot of investment.
