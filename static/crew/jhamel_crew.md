Shran's partner in Jhamelharon could have been an interesting card. The MED makes sense, sure - the DIP, absolutely; you could have swung in the direction of SCI for a tertiary, or perhaps, if you were feeling cheeky, maybe even CMD, since she operated a drone ship telepresence unit (you kind of had to be there). The latter combination could have even proven quite titillating with the right numbers.

But alas, her value is as obscured as her face, seen only through a veil of 'yes, but what is she FOR?' Well, that's what we're here to puzzle out for you. And the answer is . . . uh, hm. A handful of traits that could pop an event or two a year, including Telepath, Communicator, Inspiring, Romantic . . . maybe, if you're feeling charitable, Andorian?

An Evasion+Accuracy ship passive that could pique the interest of those who like to get frisky in the Arena, perhaps? A fun, ENT themed bridge picture with Shran, Archer and Lissan?

In the end, while I'm sure Shran would challenge me to the Ushaan for saying it, she's the Legendary equivalent of an Amanda Grayson on 95% of rosters, and best avoided in the same fashion. Unless your name is Thy'lek, swipe left.
