Here comes Gunnery Sgt De Lancie with another Q variant to get the cadets into line. He is hard, you will not like him. The more you hate him, the more you will learn! He didn’t make any effort to get to the top of the DIP ranks. If WRG wanted him up there he would have miracled his ass up there.

We can’t really muster up too much excitement for another CMD/DIP crew to roll off the production line, even if his power levels remain serviceable. He’s the best Q variant with DIP but seeing as the competition is the lacklustre Mariachi Q we'll hold off the celebrations for now. Voyage ranks which wouldn't be bad for any other skill set evoke a shrug in this case as the bloated CMD/DIP/SEC has a ton of competition, leaving Marine on voyages, again, serviceable.

So, without further ado we send Q off to the “Big Book Home Of Redundant Skill Sets” with a five gun salute and Nova Squadron performing some charming aerial displays. Ten-hut!
