Here comes Gunnery Sgt De Lancie with another Q variant to get the cadets into line. He is hard, you will not like him. The more you hate him, the more you will learn! He didn’t make any effort to get to the top of the DIP ranks. If WRG wanted him up there he would have miracled his ass up there.

We can’t really muster up too much excitement for another CMD/DIP crew to roll off the production line and if Marine Q had a few more points in the right areas he might even be worth adding the universe of Q variants. He’s the best Q variant with DIP but seeing as the competition is the lacklustre Mariachi Q we will hold off the celebrations for now. His event usage is probably where he will get most of his worth and his events do come up semi regularly. But don’t expect to get much more value out of him than a handful of shuttle seats maybe once a year.

So, without further ado we send Q off to the “Big Book Home Of Redundant Skill Sets” with a five gun salute and Nova Squadron performing some charming aerial displays. Ten-hut!
