The top ENG base for Common crew (sitting just above the much maligned Ensign Kim) is merely boilerplate for a crew who's a one-stop Collection shop. Enemy Lines Torres is the only Common rarity Innovator, Klingon, and Jury Rigger, meaning she is an automatic Immortalization until the end of the game.

But while it's tempting to do so early on thanks to her Cadet eligibility Monday through Friday, she's also rated as one of the most difficult common crew to level. Keep her Maquis and KCA faction item cost in mind if you have superior Uncommon or Rare ENG options waiting in the wings.

An absolute diamond-in-the-rarity rough who may need to wait a little while until new rosters can support the leveling (and replicator) cost, but worth the effort for players at any stage of the game.
