Lurch no longer butlers your Voyages or daily Shuttles due to age, but at least he had the foresight to snag a few non-bloated Traits to ensure Event and Collection potential when the wheel of fortune stops outside his cave. The Android Collection is Geoffrey's retirement nest egg, meaning everyone has at least some reason to Fuse up and Immortalize Ferguson and waiting on the rest of his Traits to hit is just playing with house money. Ruk could hit the Grand Slam and go four-for-four with his Traits if fortune smiles on him.
