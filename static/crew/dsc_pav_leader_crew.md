A strong Voyage Skill set with power to match is something we’d love to see on our higher Rarity options, but may give Pav a bit of early game staying power in that area. For players with a longer term focus, it’s her top shelf Evasion among Uncommon options and primo Collection profile that piques our interest. With a build cost that’s light on Faction Items and Cadet Mission eligibility on Tuesday and Thursday, Pav gives you a Trillian reasons to Immortalize her early on.
