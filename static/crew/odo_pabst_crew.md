What does Odo’s alter ego offer until those Far Beyond The Stars rumors materialize? Well, he does claim his character’s variant Events, but with mostly bloated Trait pools and no weekend help from them to date, the clip at which he collects Shuttle bonuses is limited.

On the flip side, those large Traits also give him fairly strong Collection security for the ones he’s already been included in. Overall hurting for opportunity or daily use power, Pabst is a fine mid-range Behold selection thanks to his Collections and name relevance, but is certainly a skippable option if your Behold includes a crew that would contribute immediately on your roster.
