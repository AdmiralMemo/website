Dude looks like a pineapple. What are you going to use a pineapple for? ... Malcom, return back to your post, please. 

Dolim's lifeline is his Trait set. It's provided several Event chances thus far, though you're looking at a very rough pair of Bases that won't make the thaw list for fleshed out rosters. Beyond that, you're either sticking him on the end of your Shenzhou in the early game to go boom or hoping they expand his Collection portfolio to a max of four.
