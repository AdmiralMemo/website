"A man shouldn't allow his enemies to outlive him." - Tain may have one foot in the gauntlet grave, but strikes back at his enemies with an oft-seen 45% crit trait set which features the CMD skill; a role/roll he's familiar with, boasting a top five CMD proficiency. Two low ranked pairs aren't quite the same as having Kahless himself on your squad, but Tain will do well as a rotational piece. 

Nothing resembling a good investment, Tain may luck into some requisition work for likely Cardassian events down the line if you're forced (at SEC point) to star him up.
