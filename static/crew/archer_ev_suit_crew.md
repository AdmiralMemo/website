After being one of the last holdouts for an event feature, the second half of 2018 suddenly brought Archer a double feature, a mega, and one more bonus for good measure. The sad fact is that Archer will never be a major event player, but recent history and some mega-able traits highlight a CMD base that can still make a difference. What used to be a useable voyage stack has been flooded with a number of more viable options, and the simple fact of the matter is CMD/SEC is so common that you can fill the requisite voyage seats quite easily with just mega options without losing much effiacy. Jury Rigger is still a valuable commodity and with Archer's event count finally growing to match his base, he's becoming a more tempting investment for those looking to complete the difficult collection.
