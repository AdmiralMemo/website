Late bloomer Archer will never be a major event player, but once WRG remembered that he's the Captain, he's had a fairly reliable number of variant Events since. EV Suit is plainly a low power option, but with a good potential Collection ceiling and the right Skills to merit a thaw a few times per year.

He's in the mix as a low-end Behold option for the foreseeable future and could end up being a Retrieval target in the late game to finish a handful of Collections if things break right for him.
