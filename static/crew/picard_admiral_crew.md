This imposter Pi-card is well-rounded, but with old school power. A now-redundant Skill set and weak Bases are a problem for the typical avenues of daily use, but some new player Gauntlet ability, usable Accuracy on Ships, and Picard Events with a dash of intriguing Traits are enough to make him worth picking up for most players.

Can you win any Gauntlet matchups with him against the big boys? No you can't! Don't even try!
