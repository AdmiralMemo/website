I gotta take a little time, to stop hostile Klingon takeovers
I better read between the lines, before I get my wife's cold shoulder

Now it's bat'leth practice time, with stiff leather upon my shoulders
Through the crowd I see bloodwine, it keeps me warm as life grows colder

On his knife I see lots of bloodstains
I thank God, that Kohlar helped me to train
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, to change this lonely life

I want to know what love is, B'Elanna can show me
I want to feel what love is, this T'Greth can blow me
