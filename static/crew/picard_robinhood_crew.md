A big SEC base, handful of events, and top 1/3rd voyage numbers will keep him busy on most rosters and his vanity collection spot is a nice post-fusion perk. Plus pencil mustaches are making a comeback. The skill set is a bummer and will get him replaced more quickly than others on voyages, but his shuttle work should endure and is his namesake show should provide above average event chances in the years to come.
