We were allowed to serve a dollop or two more of praise up for Emo Chip Data back before Red Angel joined the game. He was a legitimate Gauntlet option in a competitive DIP/ENG stack. Now he’s merely hoping to win the coin flip against her when used with a Crit advantage and is only more than a curiosity in his lone 45% Gauntlet.

Unless you’re a brand new player, Emo is probably freezer bound, but will at least catch a handful of Events each year and has a Collection profile sitting just above average. Due to his weak Bases, don’t expect to use him much before Immortalization.
