Perennial event work and one acceptable gauntlet pair are the highlights of an aging card, but even those have drawbacks. Data's only ranked gauntlet pair has a single 45% gauntlet, which is fine for a rotational piece, but he's an inflexible option if the skills don't align. And with a campaign Data demolishing Emo's DIP base while the super rare Prospero bests it until 5/5, Emo Chip Data is more of an 'and 1' than shuttle anchor.

Previously adaquate voyage work is circling the drain as sub-200 voyage scores usually need a more rare skill set than what Emo brings to the table. He remains a fairly well-rounded crew with the Data brand name, but his lack of power will be noticeable on all but the newest rosters.
