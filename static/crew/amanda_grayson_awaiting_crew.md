What's she awaiting, you ask? For Spock to put away his...Spock...and help his father out of a life-threatening situation? For her next wardrobe change? For better alliteration, perhaps? The answer, dear reader, is all of the above. The voyage score may not pop quite as brightly as her boa, but any crew that sits in the same skill set as Humbled Archer or Merry Men Troi is worth consideration.

Despite possible Disco variants in her future, her distinct lack of traits and history of not qualifying for megas she's part of mean you should be looking at her mainly as a voyage cog, where her smattering of MED/CMD and top five DIP/MED voyage pair may actually end up impressing you if you invest in her. In a year's time, she's likely to be on the right side of daily use crew, and since she isn't nestled in a deadly six pack, the cost of snagging a star isn't too high for an established roster.

That being said, a lack of almost any other benefits to your roster (her top ten DIP base will be top thirty within a year, given how WRG stuffs the ranks) make her a tricky citation candidate, so unless you're a hardcore Jane Wyatt fan, take the journey to Babel with caution.
