What's she awaiting, you ask? For Spock to put away his...Spock...and help his father out of a life-threatening situation? For her next wardrobe change? For better alliteration, perhaps? The answer, dear reader, is all of the above. The only thing that really pops for Amanda, outside of her feather boa, is her Trait list, and unfortunately, it doesn’t pop all that much. 

She might be topped out at her current two Collections, and if she finds herself in more than that, we might be seeing the end of the game. Oh wait, let’s include a positive attribute here… when her name is indeed called for weekend work, her DIP-led Skill set will give her a chance to be seated on Faction Shuttles.
