T’Pol’s (lack of) power won’t offer much to your roster day to day, leaving her handful of Events and Traits as her only relevant attributes. Generally uncompetitive Bases might merit a look for variant Events, but often get buried in the shuffle of larger Mega Event bonus pools. Finish T’Pol to access her two current Collections and hope for one to two more later.
