2018 was a simpler time. Klingon Events were still popping off, Kolos was making Voyages, and his Skill set wasn't terribly bloated. Having taken bumps and bruises from most angles since then, Mr. Hertzler is now more of a wait-and-see Event option whose primary consideration is Collections.

But what a Collection piece. With three large Trait pools and a few others waiting their turn to activate, Kolos is as automatic of an Immortalize as it gets for established rosters looking to rack up Skill Boosts in the late game.
