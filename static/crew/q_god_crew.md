Over a year removed from his debut mega event, Qod is just about where you'd expect him to be - in the rotation for daily use on shuttles and voyages, but without a particularly unique attribute. With the addition of a Q Contiuum collection, Qod's MED prowess on voyages has him on the short list to be the one legendary crew needed to finish the stat-booster and the strength of his base should guarantee him Faction event work for a while to come, even if you collect the (few) superior options for his skill.
