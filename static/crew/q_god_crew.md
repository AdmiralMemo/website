You can read more about this former mega crew in The Big Book of Fish Jokes, but Qod's effectiveness is no laughing matter. Sharing a legendary skill order with only Mobile Doc who sits a cool 200 voyage ranks below him (~10.5% power), he's one of the top MED voyagers and in many circumstances should be giving the boot to 2-skillers Culber or Pulaski if you're using them in that capacity.

Similarly for base, Qod continues the march of crew climbing the ladder to try and reach the #1 overall MED leader Culber. If you've never had the chance to snag the Disco Demigod, Qod should soften the blow and approximate Culber's fused power in most situations. He's the first (but not last) Q continuum crew with the MED skill and will monopolize their events' shuttles as well as bettering former MED megas for non-bonus situations without crowding them out of voyages. He's a row of zeroes elsewhere, but big base power, an average event clip, and a great voyage compliment makes it worth paying for his last star on any roster.
