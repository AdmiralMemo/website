This Tuvok is as you might expect from a 'middle aged' 2-Skiller; reliant on Traits for relevance. With Tim Russ getting a shamefully small amount of love from WRG, his Traits have done an admirable job of keeping Warship's pair of Shuttle-friendly Bases relevant on the weekend.

They also give him a reasonable Collection future, though only one has borne fruit in that regard as of this writing. With a scoop of Instant Damage hidden behind a Trigger as a one star offering, Warship is a fine low end Behold dart throw, but may be subject to stretches of irrelevance depending on the way the Trait winds blow.
