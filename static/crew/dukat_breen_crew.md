Breen Disguise Dukat is from the episode where he sits on a giant spike and Kira has to pull it out of his ass. But just in case you need any more reason to acquire him... 

This Dukat variant is a serious Trait boi. A list of characteristics bigger than his ego, none of which are Human, Federation, or Starfleet? *Chef's kiss* 

Tapped and untapped Collection Traits are the engine of this card, making him an automatic Behold choice for players past a certain point in their Timelines journey. His Event potential remained cloaked for the first several years of his time in game, but if and when those Traits do decloak, his SEC/CMD skill set will find ample Shuttle seating which can help compensate for Bases which, frankly, indicate the age of this card. Somewhat limited outside of Collections, but not as big of a pain in the ass as Kira would have you think. Look for BDD to tap out eventually at a girthy sextet of Collections, which ainâ€™t so bad.
