Red's Mega Event welcoming party went something like "Uuggghh another CMD/DIP/SEC?" and his daily work has predictably not been great since then, but as we navigate WRG's Collection fun house, Thrax's rather alluring Trait set may be his redemption arc. Seven Traits, with a variety of viability, are a bounty and while they've not yet paid off on the weekend, many of them are not so large that they can't catch bonuses, especially as a sidecar to a new Collection.
