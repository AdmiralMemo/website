SEC/ENG/MED is a pairing with a very specific history, and, arguably, a very specific trajectory. The progenitor, Temporal Prisoner Chakotay, came out in 2017, and as the years have gone by and the power has sagged, along came Ba'ul, Prisoner Kim, and now, just over three years later, comes the first Son of Mogh to break the CMD/DIP/SEC glut.

In many ways, EV Worf is a strict upgrade to Ba'ul, sporting equivalent voyage power, but not reliant on the hype train of Disco megas to stay relevant on the weekends (timely, considering said hype train appears to have just derailed) and possessing just enough traits that he'll find you a few more pieces of stray antimatter along the way. 

It's especially worth noting that we're on our second 'racial' mega in a row, and if the trend continues and we find ourselves in the middle of a Klingon mega come 2021, you'll find him holding fast with the #3 Klingon SEC, #4 Klingon ENG, and, somehow, the #1 Klingon MED. A spot in the relatively easy EV Suit collection is a nice little value add, but don't expect him to be anchored by it as newer, shinier cards come out after him. As Worf cards go, this is definitely the most unique and arguably the most fun, but as always, be wary of wading into six packs, even for characters as delicious as this.
