“It’s made of our sh!t, you know.” Yes, Admiral Vance, aka Space Carlos Olivera aka Admiral Ardeth Bay, was an oft-requested crew card once he debuted in Star Trek: Discovery, but he did so with a boring CDS Skill set and not enough raw Voyage power to overcome it. 

However, he’s not without his charm, not unlike Oded Fehr himself; his boring PRI/SEC stack of CMD/DIP makes him attractive for Shuttle seating, and with a cacophony of Traits to provide one-off or Mega Event bonuses, he can pitch in any weekend his name is called. Same cornucopia of Traits gives him an above-average Collection profile; a quartet in hand plus possibly two more in waiting makes him a solid Legendary Behold choice or Crew Retrieval target. Now, let him get back to killing T-virus zombies… or is it resurrected mummified Egyptian high priests… or is it the Emerald Chain?
