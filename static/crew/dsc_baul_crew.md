First of all, 'Ba'ul movement' is a hilarious account name and I can't be convinced otherwise. Secondly, despite looking like something that Armus coughed up, there's some value here.

On Ships, Ba'ul's 400% boomstick may be helpful to many players despite a Cloak Trigger. Its short and eclectic Trait set doesn't do it any favors for Events, though they may bear fruit as Collection options down the line.
