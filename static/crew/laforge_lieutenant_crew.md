While the application of the Romantic trait is among the most egregious in the game, it’s a nice distraction from the rest of this card. Without cadet eligibility to justify an early leveling push, the only carrot on the end of the long term value stick is a spot in the Innovator collection. By the time that number might grow to include a few of his other traits, his daily offerings will lag even further behind. Feel free to skip La Forge early on unless you’re completely lacking ENG options.
