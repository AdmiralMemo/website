We'd all love to snag his Collections and massive Event count, but bad Base and Voyage numbers are not the payoff you'd expect for a torturous build which includes sixty-four Uncommon IDICs and 150+ faction items overall. Even if/when he reaches a third Event feature, small bonus Legendary crew may come close to or surpass his effectiveness. 

The Collection era of Timelines makes Spock a somewhat necessary crew to acquire with four current inclusions and a chance to make it an even six, but at what cost?! AT WHAT COST?!
