Alita arrives to kick tribble ass! Well, her inexperienced Starfleet cousin does at any rate. Purple CMD/SCI has not been the most populated pairing until recent times and it makes sense that the Prodigy Of Pike should be quite proficient in this field. Scoring in the top ten for Super Rare voyagers and keeping up with some of the older Legendary cards as a CMD/SCI voyager is no small achievement. 

Even for Disco events she's a fine stand-in for shuttle seats, however if you have that field well covered in Legendary crew donâ€™t expect her to ship out every day, and even though her voyage pairings are very respectable for a purple she can be easily replaced with a few citations thrown in the correct direction. Her Crit Bonus ability fires off quick enough to be used with some damage dealers which increases her Arena/Skirmish viability, bearing a striking resemblance to Platonian Kirk or Pel. But for Disco Faction events Lucero is more than useful. She is just a shell, not good, not bad. That part is up to you.
