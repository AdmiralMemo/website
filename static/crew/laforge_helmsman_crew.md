A reasonable voyager, Geordi also offers a primary ENG skill that can be difficult for new players to stockpile. The issue is that when you’re first starting out and trainers are precious, you’ll want to maximize your cadet coverage with nonhuman and female crew options and Geordi often ends up as resources better allocated elsewhere. Still, he’s not an awful crew to prioritize early on and requires only a handful of faction items to immortalize.
