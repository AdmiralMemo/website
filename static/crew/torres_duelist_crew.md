Unlikely to contribute on weekdays, Duelist is more of a luxury event pick with great collections, like most Torres variants. Both of her bases were recently topped, but she also has a handful of possible one-off event traits, such as Athlete. There's theoretical gauntlet value for a pair rated at 83% of maximum, but with two average rolls, she will need both skills to line up and often performs better on paper than in game.

With the Jury Rigger collection no longer needing quite so many 5* crew for you to get the maximum benefits, her place in it is more of a happy coincidence for people who stumble into multiple copies of her, rather than a reason to target her in particular. Torres lovers had best hold out hope for an expansion to Rigger and Innovator for a reason to justify taking this antiquated card.
