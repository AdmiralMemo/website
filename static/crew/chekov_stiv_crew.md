We were going to go with a vessel/wessel joke here, but when you catch yourself looking up V words on Scrabble’s website, you’re probably going too far for a joke. Which is what Chekov crew were for years before the Resourceful apology collection landed, boosting the value of most of his variants.

This Rare variant, ineligible for any cadet work, is unfortunately pointed toward daily use, an area of value which evaporates rapidly for lower rarity crew. So while you could immortalize him early on to help boost your voyages and shuttles, his lack of versatility dictates that he’s better left for later on once you’re simply looking for leveling projects to flesh out your collections.
