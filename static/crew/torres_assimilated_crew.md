An event piece formerly lauded for some tough collection work is now more of a shuttle time bomb, relying on a fistful of interesting traits, both tapped and untapped, to present multi-week splash opportunities. With neither Borg nor Jury Rigger requiring a gold crew to complete, Torres is a rank 40ish ENG crew whose had good luck with event opportunities so far and may into the future as well with names like Maquis, Borg, and several traits of the right bonus pool size for DB to target.
