The headline for this early 21st century version of Raffi is her Ship Ability, coming online at four seconds, making her a fine Accuracy option to pair with the Attack-Boosting T’Mir in Arena, matching activation times nicely. If you’re in Collections-or-bust mode, Raffi offers just enough in that area to beat out scores of other crew and rounds out her value nicely.
