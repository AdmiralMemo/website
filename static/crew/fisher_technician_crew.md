The mad bastards finally did it. They added the most pivotal, admired and well known character from The Cage into the game. Bravo, it only took you four years but we finally, finally have Doctor Boyce...wait, what’s that...who...oh.

Like Nish Fish himself, his card will mostly hang out being useful in the background while occasionally doing something to move the plot forward. He has numbers on his side and certainly would be a useful side project for anyone looking to up their game in the SCI/ENG leagues but he’s got nothing special going for him other than a couple of four digit figures and a arena critical that rating might earn him a spot on your ship if you're willing to wait 10 seconds for him to activate. And I guess that's about all ‘The Cage’ crew we'll get for a while until we finally get Transporter Chief Pitcairn and the bloody Kalar…
