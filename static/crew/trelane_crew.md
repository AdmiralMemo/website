A pretty fleshy, non-standard Trait set is the main value driver with Trelane. The weakest table leg is Events; between his poor Base power and large Trait pools, you may have to get several requisition Shuttles deep before he pops up as an option.

Elsewhere, however, there's value. A multi-Collection piece with a strong ceiling in that area can generally beat out plenty of older dud cards in a bad Behold and he does earn some Gauntlet play once in a blue moon. His 65% Gauntlet (A.K.A. the Q Continuum set) has him as a fine inclusion and he's the #1 SEC/SCI option for all but one of his 45%+ sets.
