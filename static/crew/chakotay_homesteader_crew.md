Bless his beautiful hide! The eighth Pontipee brother, we’ll call him Hannah or Hagar or Hepzibah, certainly looks younger than Gideon thanks to TP’s AI face-smoothing tech, but that’s no excuse as to why he can’t plow twenty acres in a day or drop a tree within an inch of where he wants it. He came to the third planet of a seven-planet star system orbiting a yellow dwarf star in the Delta Quadrant to get himself a wife and he doesn’t aim to go back home empty-handed.

While Chakotay’s busy Engineering a meet cute with Kathy, new players should feel free to stuff their shuttles or ENG voyages with this event reward if they acquired multiple copies at once. He can even repair the hull on your ships, just not his Native American storyline or the tattered remains of a forty-two minute love affair with Janeway on planet X. 

Sam the Onion man can fix Kissin’ Kate’s heart, but his utility has a leak in the bottom and he’ll be sinking to the bottom of Green Lake before you can say ‘Sploosh’.
