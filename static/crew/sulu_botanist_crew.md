You maniacs! You blew it up! Goddamn you all to hell! - Alright, maybe Mr. Heston’s apeish outburst is an overreaction, but he knows what you may not - the original art for this card looked much more like Hikaru Sulu than the finished product. Luckily for the players, something else out of character for a Sulu variant is actual, honest to God usability.

Sulu and friend remain near the top of the Super Rare Voyage power charts with a Skill set that doesn’t completely suck. Despite a wasteland of value outside of that area, Gerty helps kick Sulu’s power into overdrive and should afford this duo the opportunity to Voyage alongside your partially-Fused Legendary crew as you transition through the mid-game. Things look grim in the long term, but enjoy their fine Voyage usability while you can.
