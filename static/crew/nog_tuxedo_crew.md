Nog was the first crew to a quintet of Collections and while heâ€™s since been passed, he still maintains a healthy, above-average set to whet the appetite of the elderly player chasing those global stat boosts. He has little else to offer for daily use outside of Fleet Boss Battles Node solving, so feel free to Immortalize him, keep him thawed to help your Fleet crush the Doomsday Machine, and wait for him to hit one or two more Collections from his superb Trait list.
