Kurak's shockingly beefy Event count is decidedly backwards-looking, even if future Klingon bonuses are a distinct possibility. Therein, her SCI Base has the possibility of being thaw-worthy, but the real reason you're picking her in a Behold is the Collection value. Kurak will be a perfunctory choice at some point in your journey, but isnâ€™t a name you need to seek out to make a significant impact on any part of your game.
