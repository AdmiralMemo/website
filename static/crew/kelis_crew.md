The WWE champ is here to lay the smackdown on all your candy asses! The Big Gold belt and Ric Flair’s robe combine to provide some mystical CMD/MED power for Voyages, but unfortunately the stories told of his Voyage viability have drifted into the realm of myths and legends.

His Trait milkshake is bringing all the elderly players to the yard though; a ceiling of five Collections from his sextet of Traits is a solid conversion rate, and with a trio already in the bag, he’s a reasonable investment for both current and future value in those regards.
