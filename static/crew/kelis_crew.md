Jokes about milkshakes and charging for lessons about them aside, Kelis is a curious card, hailing from the same episode of Voyager that gave us the incomparable . . . Layna. Hm. Fittingly, considering his much larger role in said episode, Kelis looks set to have a relative longevity on voyages that Layna could only wish for, despite his relatively vanilla primary/secondary skills, and it's all thanks to that third, elusive skill.

On a Behold screen, and maybe even on a stat sheet, a tertiary MED doesn't look like much, but there are some voyage stacks that are so depreciated that even a primary/tertiary pairing like this can result in a top five voyage pair - and this is one of them. 

The MED/CMD voyagers ahead of him either have worse raw voyage scores, like Dr. Pollard or Captain Beverly, or similarly make up the difference from primary/tertiary skills, such as Mycelial Culber, which is pretty rarefied company.

Any roster, young or old, suffers a deficit of MED/CMD, and while citing a CMD/DIP legendary seems like an odd way to go about addressing it, someone like Kelis really is one of the better ways to do it. Your other options are to start digging through the portal, or waiting, nay, dreaming, of more immediately superior options that may never come, given the rate WRG adds them to the game. 

Elsewhere, the character lacks lustre - outside of Maverick and Writer, his traits are poor, his ship ability and Gauntlet will barely turn a head, and he has no collections on which to hang his hat - but on most rosters, a good, not great voyager with even a smidge of MED/CMD is more valuable than a dozen names that are going to get events 'any day now!' or empty calorie bases.
