She’s not the classic T’Pau we need, but because of ongoing rights issues, she’s the T’Pau we deserve right now. The Raider of the Lost Kir’Shara does alright as a starter-type crew thanks to her Ship Ability. 

With Position ships like the Shenzhou available in Dabo, T’Pau’s +10 Attack at eight seconds become more usable and can make her a worthwhile Arena/Skirmish asset for newer players. If you are still playing Hard and Brutal Fleet Boss Battles difficulties, she is one of the best Attack crew on ships with the aforementioned Position Ability. 

Likely tapped out on Collections unless longshot Telepath hits, she’s a fine choice in Super Rare Beholds but not exciting at all.
