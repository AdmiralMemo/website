"Your excellency, it is difficult, I . . . I try to pull packs, but . . . nghaaaah!" 

*vaporised* 

An iconic death, a rock solid Paul Winfield performance - and all we have to show for it is a statistically boring card that'll be frozen as soon as he's finished, sadly. About the only things that register as blips of value are Terrell's hard earned Hero and Undercover Operative traits, where his serviceable but not impressive CMD base might see some use if you're still using Super Rare crew by the time either of those get a mega. His ship ability, while weighty, is shackled to awkward timing and a long charge time that just make it easier to use one of the many other instant damage crew on shorter cycles we've gotten in the past few months. About the only thing he really has going for him is truly top tier art - check out the shadowing on his uniform and the light sources hitting his hands and face . . . then put him in the freezer.
