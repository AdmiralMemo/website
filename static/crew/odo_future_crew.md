For those that don’t have Tilly, there’s Odo. Second highest Uncommon DIP stat which will be incredibly handy until Shran or Florist Q drop from the portal. One of the best crewmembers to use on the Alien Cadet Missions and slowly but surely collecting Collections from his Trait list. Like all Uncommon crew, useful until he’s not.
