Lining up Cloak Triggers with Auto mode in the Arena has become something of an arcane art and so even though Alex's huge Crit Bonus ability may look appealing, it's often best to pivot to an ease-of-use option instead. He's also a fine SEC option in a pinch for Tuesday-only Cadet Missions, though his old man Worf is the preferable choice for that role.
Dancing around the lede here; Alexander's shining moment of laughing hour comes via a valuable, long-term collection spot thanks to half of his extensive trait list, Klingon. Perhaps not an early-game leveling project due to the Klingon and KCA faction items needed, but everyone should immortalize him sooner or later for the progress toward global skill boosts.
