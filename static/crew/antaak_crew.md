Lacking traits and with a Klingon mega in the rear view mirror, Antaak's pair of poor bases have become little more than an oddity. Buoying him to bit player on most rosters is his trio of collection spot, Episode 9 medical node unlock (geneticist), and most importantly a 65% gauntlet trait set which pairs with power good enough to make him a once-a-month visitor to your starting five.
