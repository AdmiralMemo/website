The Kukalaka waits...silently stalking your Chronitons, ready to strike. This Bashir has a build cost reputation, but the bigger issue is that he doesn't pay it off. Statistically weak in all areas of the game, he, like a handful of others, is saved by his MED-centric Skill set and brand name. 

Ugly Bases should chip in on a few Shuttles each year if he's fully fused and he has an outside shot at a couple different Gauntlets, which is an attribute available for newer players as a one star investment against other poor Behold choices. If you're taking him to max (on purpose), it's usually for the classic Bashir 1-2 Collection punch of Physician and Engineered, plus a nice splash of Gambler, and who knows if Cyberneticist will ever hit?
