One of the Youhura Trio along with Lt. Commander and Tribble, who were all released about the same time in the same triplet with about the same Voyage power, RT Uhura has a little more long term value due to (you guessed it!) her Traits! A ceiling of five puts her well above average, and those extra Traits give her extra weekend work outside of Uhuraâ€™s main cast variant chances.
