The latest action figure variant to kick off the TOS mega comes with some impressive base statistics. Currently in the top 10 for security Uhura can hold her own in a firefight certainly and with a healthy CMD modifier she guarantees her place on most of your SEC/CMD voyages should you happen to get all the stars. In contrast however she does sit in a large pile of many CMD/SEC/DIP variants no doubt attempting to squeeze into your roster like clowns in a convertable. Her event count suffers from a lack of Uhura based events and her ship ability is nothing to sing about. But if you are looking for a decent sharpshooter to boost a voyage up or hit those SEC shuttles then you can't go wrong with this card.
