Tilly has yet to experience a significant bump in Event features since the presumptive fall of Discovery Mega Events, so although her CMD base will be an easy un-freeze candidate for many rosters, those thawpertunities have been few and far between; on the level of Sulu and Scotty. The situation isn't improved by a somewhat thin Trait set which has already been harvested fully with three Collections.

The other attribute of note is a not-quite-great Arena ability whose boost is substantial for a Super Rare, but can be found on crew with better Initialization and Duration times. Certainly some use here, but not a terribly titillating Tilly.
