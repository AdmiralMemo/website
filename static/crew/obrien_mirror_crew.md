In somewhat of a rare move we have a main cast card that actually can keep up with all the ensigns! The #1 ENG crew in the Rare crew ranks but he’s not just a one Skill wonder! His Secondary Skills mean he’s got some Voyage legs too in the early game. His Ship Ability is not too shabby either, granting some useful Evasion bonuses and Shield Repair which gives him some use in Arena and Skirmish events. By the time you’ve frozen him in favor of Super Rare and Legendary upgrades, he will have already ticked the box on three stat-boosting Collections.
