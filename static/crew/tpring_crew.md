Nothing like a bad romance to evoke both the Brutal and Romantic Traits from a crew. T’Pring has found little work in Events from her thin Trait list, but clearly she’ll have no trouble finding a seat when scoring a bonus. However, it’s probably best to not count on them and be pleasantly surprised when they do hit.

Elsewhere this heartbreaker looks to recoup value by converting her Traits into Collections, hopefully at a more brisk pace than her first few years in game. Aye, she’s got a B I G B A S E, but take it from someone who knows; after a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but is often true.
