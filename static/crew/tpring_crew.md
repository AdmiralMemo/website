Nothing like a bad romance to evoke both the brutal and romantic traits from a crew. Consistently inconsistent, T'Pring should see plenty of day one shuttle usage, but primarily for low-yield daily shuttles while ceding the floor to any of a plethora of DIP bonus crew during events.

Without many bonuses of her own or broader utility to look forward to, this heartbreaker is a notch on the wall of what is currently one of the tougher collections to complete, along with some steady, if only marginally improved shuttle work.
