The huge Worf/Klingon/Hologram Event count and Collectable Traits are certainly nice, but his Stats and Skill set tell the story of a crew whose likely ceiling is as a fourth Faction Shuttle seat warmer. No lack of opportunity to excel there, but he has quite an expensive build consisting of over 100 Faction Items and pricey Components.

Heâ€™s a fine speculative crew to add stars to as his Collection value is sure to grow, but he may take some time to pay back the cost of admission.
