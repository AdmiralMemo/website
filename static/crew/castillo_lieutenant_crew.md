Shooter McGavin doesn’t have fantastic stats anywhere, but his short game is pretty good. Wait until about the end of the period in which you’re focusing on Rare Crew to finish him up, and enjoy his non-Rarity Collection and additional Traits that could give him two more. Notedly he’s one of the only three Crew below the Super Rare level with Displaced, so he might be the first notch on that Collection for you.
