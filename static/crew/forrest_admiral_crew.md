Command, Diplomacy and...Engineering? Maximillian Of The Woods is kind of an inverse Queen Po but a more relative comparison would be the Borg Queen, my oh my he keeps royal company! But in order to keep up with the Borg Queen he needs to have some more traits to call on. The raw base and voyage numbers are there to make him usable on any roster with the requisite number of stars, it's just that the rest of him screams pack filler.

Bearing in mind we have not had an Enterprise mega yet, his event usage in the future is still limited and whilst both he and Queen are similar in numbers (with Forrest having a small advantage) I would probably still prioritise the latter due to Forrest lacking any kind of flavor. Should he gain favour to be awarded your citations, he'll perform well day-to-day for the foreseeable future, though he's most likely capped at voyage piece.
