Command, Diplomacy and...Engineering? Max's uncommon Skill set and acceptable debut Voyage power made a few believers out of skeptics, but he no longer has the power to make believers out of the modern player.

With two Enterprise Mega Events now in the rear view, Maximillian Of The Woods is at the mercy of a painfully Thin trait set for future Faction bonuses. No doubt you might hear some favorable stories from people who got him 4/5 from his Campaign, but if you missed out, your justification to finish him when stronger crew come your way will primarily rest on his ceiling of a trio of Collections.
