No one will blame you for being fresh out of Dominion Faction Items - there simply aren't that many crew in the game to justify flying those Shuttles very often. The fact that Third needs almost a hundred of them means you'd better warm up your Replicator and prepare for a garbage return on investment.

Sunday Cadet Missions eligibility is nearly his only saving grace other than a sparse but fertile Trait list for future Collections.
