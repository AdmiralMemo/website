Suspiria is the kind of crew who breaks the fourth wall to illustrate how minute crew evolution can be in this game. The Power Creep™ machine will continue to churn out incrementally better Base and Voyage numbers, but in Suspiria's case she's simply, as Lieutenant Picard would say, bereft of passion and imagination.

Every corner of this card has rounded edges. By now she has nothing to offer in all game modes, and her Collection ceiling of five is almost entirely potential versus actual.

Am I still salty about WRG’s lame ass, thoughtless, goose crap Skill set for a character that embodies intrigue and exploring the unknown? Pffft nah, man. Naahhh.
