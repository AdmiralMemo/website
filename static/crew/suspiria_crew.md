Suspiria is a tremendously fascinating crew. She debuted as a top 100 voyager, behind only 17 other crew who share her skill set. Normally that might seem like a few too many, but she leverages a hefty .26% boost in voyage power over the last CMD/DIP/SEC mega; Garth of Izar. If you're looking for a strong CMD base to make a difference on weekends, why not go with one which has snagged a bonus an impressive .47% of the time prior to her mega?

Jokes aside, Suspiria is the kind of crew who breaks the fourth wall to illustrate how minute crew evolution can be in this game. The power creep machine will continue to churn out incrementally better base and voyage numbers, but in Suspiria's case she's simply, as Lieutenant Picard would say, bereft of passion and imagination.

Every corner of this card is rounded edges. A zero in the way of gauntlet, arena, or collections, she attempts to muster voyage efficacy against the stiffest skill set competition in the game and rattles her CMD sabre alongside a trait list that reads far better for the gauntlet than possible event work. (A Nacene gauntlet crew wouldn't make sense anyway...)

Just remember when the fusion level beer goggles make Suspiria look like a sound investment on your roster, how much better it would be to spend citations on an actual good crew instead.
