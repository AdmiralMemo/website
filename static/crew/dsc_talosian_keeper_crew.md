Hey, who doesn’t love MED/CMD? Unfortunately, to get much voyage work beyond the six month mark, we need to see some ‘Later losers’ top of the bell curve power for Super Rares to compete in the big leagues. He’s a fine grab for young rosters for that reason, but the rest of us will be waiting for his myriad traits to hit on some collection value. Don’t get too excited to hop in your Mini Keeper and zoom around town, it might stall on the railroad tracks.
