At one time, in short succession, three Legendary Uhurae entered the game with similar Voyage power and identical triplets. They’ve all faded into obscurity on the daily use front, but Afrohura may have fallen the hardest given that her Traits are so thin. She’s already established her two Collections and should earn Faction Event use when one of them or a variant bonus is declared, but other than that, choose her from a Legendary Behold when there are no better options.
The downsides are obvious; skill set, limited event chances, and "Afro Pick Sold Separately!", but you can only ding a crew so much who fulfills the most potential that her limitations would allow. If you collect the requisite number of stars, she's guaranteed value for you, even if she promises not to age as well as her namesake.
