As far as launch cards go, it's a 'mild shock' :O that Wes still has some fringe benefits. His Arena Evasion Activates quickly enough and lasts long enough for most situations while his SCI/Prodigy combination can unlock a handful of Nodes in Galaxy Missions. Good for just one or two Events yearly, his only real shot to improve in value would be another Warp Theorist Mega Event or Collection.
