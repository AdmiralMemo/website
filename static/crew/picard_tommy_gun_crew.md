Look, sweetheart, you're gunna want this fella. Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow. But soon...and for the rest of your life. Only a few crew can unlock a particular SEC/Investigator node and if you missed former mega Thrax, then Dix might be your best option. And while his voyage numbers and skill set are not helpful, nor is what he brings to the gauntlet and arena, he ticks three Collection notches (two Stat-Boosting) including the massive 140 threshold Costume Party.

While his event count is a nice perk, there are so many Picard versions floating around that his primary, SEC, comes well shy of likely Faction Shuttle use. With his namesake tv show sadly finished (for now?), don't expect many more chances to roll him out.
