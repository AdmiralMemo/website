Chekov's Events (and poor Traits) are scattershot at best, so a player doing the slow Fuse one star at a time through Beholds should be focused on his Collections. Heâ€™ll top out at three including a payoff from the hidden evsuit Trait, so look for an occasional Chekov Event to spur a Thaw from Cryostasis.
