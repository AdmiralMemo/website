Leather Daddy Lorca has the art and the cool factor and...

Event tally is the number that pops, but with Disco Mega Events dead (or are they?) as Lorca himself, his ultra consistent 2017-2020 stretch of event work is unlikely to be mirrored. Still, that's his selling point and he should catch a smattering of Events in which to use his Shuttle-friendly Bases.

Thin Collection value with a low ceiling there...no daily use...maybe you take him to one of his many 45% Gauntlets for fun until Balok and MJLP remind you why you'll never do that again? Lorca is the embodiment of the credo; Cite for Love.
