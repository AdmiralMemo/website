“Not’pol” is infamous throughout the Captain Division of Arena for her Instant Damage at four seconds with hefty Passive Evasion, T'Mir is also becoming something of a Collection Kwik-E-Mart. With a handful in the holster already and a surprisingly steady Event history, she should be attractive to rosters at every level.
