Fairly useful in several areas, though most of them are niche. His good SEC base is a nice shuttle stuffer for a couple events per year and though Mirror is an MIA trait that shouldn't be bet on going forward, it's one of a couple that could still trigger a thaw. If you happen to fuse him early on, there's some voyage potential and he offers a +9 attack boost in the arena which is a hair slow, but an essential asset for shortening the ship battle grind.
