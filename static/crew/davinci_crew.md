Saluti! Allow me to regale you with the story of Leonardo da Timelines. The first Legendary to sport the ENG/SCI/MED Skill set is *old* in game terms, yet he remains more valuable than almost any crew his age.

Leo’s delicious Trait mélange has afforded him plenty of whacks at the Event piñata and more should continue to trickle in from Trait Mega Events and one-offs. It also gives him superb Collection value with a handful of potential Traits waiting to add to an already strong set of large Collections.

While Leo spent many years as a top Voyager, that ship has unfortunately sailed, but with a huge number of elevated Crit sets in the Gauntlet and reasonable ENG/MED Proficiency pair, there’s something of value here for players at every level of the game.
