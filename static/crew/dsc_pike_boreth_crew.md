At first impression, this particular Pike may seem like a Bore-th, but there's actually quite a lot of long term value to be found here if you take the time to inspect that point of light - fitting, for a man who's just seen his future play out in front of him.

A top ten CMD base is almost certain to find use, between potential Discovery, Explorer, and Strange New Worlds-boosted Pike events. And double collections, including the all-powerful Diplomat, mean he'll be pulling weight even if you never pull him out of the freezer again.

He'll also provide good early game Arena attack boosts to those of you who haven't had the luck to stumble into a fully fused legendary or his Disco contemporaries, Sarek and Mirror Burnham. It's rare for a card to straddle the short term to the endgame in this way, but they do happen, and you should take them where you can.
