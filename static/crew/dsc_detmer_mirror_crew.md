This iteration of Detmer is probably one of my most anticipated cards which makes it such a shame that's she's such disappointing addition. SEC/CMD is about as vanilla a skill set as you can get and although she hits #2 with that pairing in voyages her two skilled nature make that completely redundant as it would be a negative should one want to hit a ten hour voyage.

This will be one of the few occasions where having a large event potential would be a negative. Disco and Mirror event capable crew have pretty much reached saturation now and if you've been playing for a while you will have accrued a large number of them with little effort. Most of which will be significantly more useful than Commandant Reaction-Shot here.

To focus on the positives she has a nice 400% damage hit at 8s, not as fast as her Mirror Universe compatriot Captain Killy but still enough to put a dent in any skirmish lineup. However unless you have no damage dealers, no Disco or Mirror crew or, for some reason, no decent SEC/CMD crew she is mostly useless to you in all other capacities.
