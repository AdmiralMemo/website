“All I can do is kill him...and that no longer holds my interest.” 

Ikat'ika has the right Skill set for Shuttles, but his bonuses are mostly reliant on some flimsy Traits outside of Dominion. A pair of Event features probably aren't his last ones - at least, let's hope not as his only other tangible, non-Collection use is as an Ardra replacement in the Arena akin to Pel or Platonian Kirk.
