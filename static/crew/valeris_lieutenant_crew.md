Reprehensible Bases make the Event count meaningless in this case, but four Event features - three of which were a Galaxy (10x bonus) - probably will make a splash for most users. Valerisâ€™ main daily contribution comes in the Gauntlet where her strong overall Proficiency meets a pair of 45% Crit Gauntlets; new players should be able to utilize her well early on.

Her Ship Ability is worth a look as a fast Activating Accuracy Boost, though it lacks the Crit punch of Ardra or her many lesser disciples. With a middling Collection profile in tow, Valeris remains pretty well rounded and certainly a far better performing Super Rare than almost any other from 2016.
