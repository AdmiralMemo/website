Corny was the prototypical powerhouse MED crew and songs are still sung of her deeds, but "Eyes open, Veer" when approaching her as a project from the ground up. No longer a viable Voyager, resist the temptation of overvaluing an old Mega Event Recurring Legendary crew.

Corny's modest combination of immediate and potential Collections can be matched by most crew and her Bases don't stand out in any regard. A reasonable crew to take Behold stars on thanks to her strong debut power, but not a card who should be eating Citations when Power Creepâ„¢ is printing plainly stronger cards.
