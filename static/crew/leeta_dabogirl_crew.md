How much can you trust the judgment of someone whose love for Rom is that unflagging? Without a solid Uncommon DIP option to cover all five days of cadet work, it’s feasible that Leeta is one of the crew you might employ to help out with that coverage. She’s so unremarkable elsewhere, however, that you should feel free to pass on lending her a crew slot until her letter B traits blossom into collection value down the line.
