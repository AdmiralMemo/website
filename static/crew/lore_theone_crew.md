You can review his Ship Ability quote if you'd like the more brief synopsis, but suffice it to say, Lore is not a daily use option. As with most crew this age we're tunnel visioning on Traits, which Lore happens to have fairly well stocked.

Already the proud owner of multi-Collection status, his ceiling in that area is higher than most while his Traits have landed him a respectable Event tally. He'll remain a low end Behold option until he has an infinity gauntlet worth of Collections, but isn't the dead end that his surface level Stat metrics would suggest.
