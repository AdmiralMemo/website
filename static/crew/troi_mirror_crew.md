Dominatroix has the tools to fulfill your every wish. #1 variant MED with two scoops of events, respectable voyage power for a MED primary, and underrated gauntlet viability. Drooping stat ranks don't affect MED primary crew in the same way as other skills - she may not be the best in any one area, but is one of the more complete MED crew in the game.
