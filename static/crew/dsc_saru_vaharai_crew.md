Legendary Sarus are fairly neapolitan, spanning the power levels from obscure to obscene. The Vahar’ai variant draws one of the shorter straws in this case. While still functional for Events, DIP is a Skill that Saru variants don’t lack. With his Traits less likely to score a bonus than they seem at a glance, Vahar’ai will often be bullied by his older brothers’ obnoxiously large Bases.

As a former Campaign crew, you’ll find enough players willing to share how their Saru performs, just be sure to shave a power level or two off of that assessment if you’re starting a first star investment from the ground up.
