In the vein of Lt. Commander Spock and Enterprise Pike, this first SNW version of Una is blandly-arted and named, but has a lot to offer still after a strong debut. Still capable on Voyages depending on the rest of your roster, Number One has a better-than-average Skill set and order owing to her ENG Tertiary, but sheâ€™s quickly fading in this area for most. A trio of Collections once Explorer hits shortly (it may have already by the time you read this note) and a viable Pilot Trait left to hit gives her a decent Collection profile, and serviceable Primary and Secondary Bases give her a chance to ride Faction Event Shuttles when her Traits or variants are called to action. If WRG gives Una a Trait update a la Gabriel Lorca, you could even see a bit more value in that area someday, but we are not holding our breath.
