Hardly an Event name, Keiko can at least claim a handful of Event-able Traits to push flat Bases into service on the odd occasion. Of more interest to many players are her Collections, including Vanity, with room to grow in that area (up to a quintet someday). This is not a Crew that anyone "needs", but is there as a leveling project and Collection stuffer for players who have graduated past the part of the game where they use their Super Rares for day to day operations.
