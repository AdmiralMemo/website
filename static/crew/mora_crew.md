Poor MED and SCI bases are usually detrimental but his Proficiency gives him some legs should you need a good Voyage in that category in the very early game. However there are quite a few options available with other Rare crew holding much better and stronger combinations of that Skill. We are still waiting for the promised Bajoran Collection at the time of this writing, but at least he checks the Exobiology box in the interim.
