We weren't kind to Ms. Brahms â€¦ Sorry, Mrs. Brahms when she debuted, and although she's held up well in the time since, her trajectory was always self-evident. Both of her traits whose numbers aren't overflowing did catch their megas during her first year in service, which, in combination with good voyage metrics, has made her a fairly strong crew. But now with her traits tapped and stat ranks teetering, perhaps the only thing unique left about Geordi's dreamboat is a hair slow arena evasion that few can match, provided you meet her trigger requirement.
