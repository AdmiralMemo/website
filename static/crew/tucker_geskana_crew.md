Shirtless art to pair with Scott Frontula's portrayal of Humbled Archer is worth a few tiers in somebody's book, but it won't gain him any clout around here. Probably.

Tucker provides three pillars of benefit in varying amounts of usefulness. On voyages, his bloated skill set will undercut what are pretty good voyage numbers on debut. There's a narrow window of rosters who might utilize that (especially if he weren't coming from a 6-pack), but his appearing the same week as a 4/5 legendary CMD/DIP/SEC giveaway only highlights how easy the skill set is to acquire.

Tucker's two year event drought should soon snap and return him to a modest pace of 1-2 events per year, plus whatever his thin trait set adds on top of that. A four digit DIP base (with bonuses) is worth the thaw even if bonus opportunities aren't plenty.

Most likely to be of use for newer players is his +9 attack boost on ships. Trip's combined attributes don't justify the delve into his inaugural 6-pack, but if you collect him for the art or while chasing other crew, he has a few edge case assets.
