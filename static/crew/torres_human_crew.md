We almost never reference a crew’s tier in their note as it’s such a variable metric which can render the note out of date. But in order for WRG to make this one look foolish, Torres is going to need to hit on several collections in succession to escape the sludge of tier ten. Brute Force Isn’t Going To Do It as her bases are fitting of the 2019 two-skiller that she is and Torres has always been a second (or third) level event name. If you’re forced into selecting her in a behold, take solace in that she hasn’t yet hit her collection ceiling.
