When you're looking at a crew's selling point being Wesley Crusher Events, you probably took a wrong turn in a really bad part of town. The entirety of Wes' pre-cryo value to your roster is summed up by a handful of Prodigy Node unlocks on the Galaxy Map. Once those are clear, you can expect a thaw or two per year if there are enough SCI/ENG seats to go around. Heâ€™s got a slot in the Prodigy Collection and if WRG ever gets around to it, a spot in a hypothetical future Pilot one.
