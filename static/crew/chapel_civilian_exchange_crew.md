When this Chapel hits your Legendary Behold screen, don’t let the unicorn Skill set and order fool you; she’s not good. Without enough power left in the tank to make that Skill set really POP on your Voyages, Christine is left with little more than her Trait list; slender as it might be. Perhaps two to three viable Traits for Collections and Events, and then newish Nurse Voyage Antimatter Trait giving her perhaps a wee bit of life on in that game mode, just grab yourself a newer, funner variant of Chapel and ignore this bland one.
