See Palamas, Grecian Carolyn for Barrowsâ€™ art contemporary. Surely there will be more than a few Bridge Crews adorned with these lovely dresses. Sadly, the art is the best part of this crew. A narrow Trait set half-comprised of non-viable Traits leaves her with a ceiling of three Collections, which leaves us wanting more. Should she hit one or two more Collections, she MIGHT just then become a low-end Legendary Behold option, but not beforehand.
