An often-overlooked option for Ships, Raffi is among the top Super Rare Instant Damage crew with a +8 or better Attack Boost, making her mini-Killy in that respect and headlines the offerings from this card. Her other attributes are more ethereal, however.

Workable Shuttle Bases are yearning for some help via Trait or show bonuses, and her Trait list is almost certainly tapped out at a pair of Collections. Raffi's usable in a few areas, but you may have to look for ways to utilize her rather than her being a natural fit like some cards.
