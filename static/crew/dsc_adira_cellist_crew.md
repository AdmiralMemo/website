Adira followed Culber's lead to ring in their Timelines career, boasting three worthwhile, available Legendary variants in a short span. Naturally, a cooldown period was due - enter Cellist Adira. There's nothing concrete here for veteran players, particularly after the Discovery mega era (even though its demise may have been exaggerated), though a few off-center Traits are in the right range for Event or Collection bumps down the line. Merely serviceable in most areas, Cellist is a crew that would have benefited from being a Galaxy event reward as a building block for young rosters. As it stands, enjoy the art and wait for their Trait lineup to warrant them another look in the future with perhaps one more inclusion in a Romantic collection?
