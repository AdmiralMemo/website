She ain't TOS' Galliulin, but she ain't bad. Irina survived the 2019 onslaught of SEC/ENG crew with only 6-pack Tribble Scotty besting her voyage power over the course of the year. That area remains her calling card and she's a straight voyage upgrade over former mega Determined Janeway, providing power that should stick around long enough for you to fuse (or cite) her. Her other components are somewhat lacklustre, highlighted by a #3 gauntlet pair which, if it's that important to you, super rare Grand Proxy Neelix is there for, and a spot in Jury Rigger - the toughest stat-boosting collection.
