The great, almighty Suzie Q herself. Though she isn’t quite the representation we might have been hoping for (some players might even say that they will try . . . to fix Q. No? Working on it, promise), she’s a SCI/CMD voyager with punch and a handy tertiary ENG to keep her relevant even as you find yourself transitioning to legendary crew. That being said, her events prospects are pretty dire (I think the Astronomer mega is due right after the Brat mega), and the moment you freeze her, I find it unlikely you’ll find a good reason to unthaw her again - unless you just really like looking at Suzie Plakson. Which, to be fair, a lot of us do.
