If you’re eyeballing Captain Planet, you’re either a very new player, a very old player, or are banking on high waisted belts making a comeback. Orion’s two attributes of note, Gauntlet and Ship Ability, both point toward young rosters and are good introductory offerings.

Long time players will scoff at a twelve second Activation on ships, but Triggerless Instant Damage in a strong amount is just peachy for Skirmishes or more defensive Arena setups and most importantly will save you a Crew Retrieval in the early game while still helping to address that deficiency on your roster.

More broadly appealing are a reasonable set of Proficiencies for the Gauntlet. In the mold of Lara and Prophet Kira who came just before, Orion is similarly SEC/CMD-oriented and tops out at 25% Crit in any given Gauntlet.

For veteran players, Orion may merely be a once-in-a-blue-moon Gauntlet pick and string of Traits.
