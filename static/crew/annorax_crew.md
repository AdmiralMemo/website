Much like the civilizations he's erased, Red's time as a top Voyager is beyond most people's memory, and in real terms he’s functionally non-functional. A Trait list that’s beefy at a glance will see the likes of Krenim, Desperate, and Theoretical Engineer boiled away before they reach the Collections and Event tabs, leaving him more anemic value in those areas than one might think.

Nevertheless, those are his two lifelines and so while it’s possible to envision a future where Annorax makes a value comeback, we may be chasing that alternate timeline for the rest of our lives.
