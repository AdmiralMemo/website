Red Forman ain't too bad for a non-event crew. Much like the civilisations he's erased, his time as a top ten SCI/CMD voyager is beyond most people's memory, and in real terms, if you're searching for a comparison to a more common crew, he's more similar to Armus than anything else, albeit with better SCI and overall numbers. If you're looking for shuttle help who can pitch in elsewhere, he's not a bad investment thanks to several potential future mega traits, but it's a game of chance you're playing with some hideous stakes if you lose. If Annorax is unlucky, you're looking at ever-sinking stat totals without much else to buoy him.
