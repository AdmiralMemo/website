The role of Captain’s Assistant must have done some good because Naomi is a powerhouse for Cadet Missions. Her ENG Skill isn’t the best for an Uncommon but being able to fill out all the Cadet Challenges and having a semi-decent Ship Ability propels her up the rankings. She and Seska fill the same roles but their Traits and dual abilities will help tackle some of the more tricky early Missions.
