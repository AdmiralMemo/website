From the depths of a coffee-starved writers' room comes this curiously potent monstrosity. Fusing Captain Janeway and Mutated Paris will produce this love child and her love children. Worthwhile base and voyage numbers to laugh in the face of Bynars and Janeway events guarantee to provide periodic value for a variant-best DIP base that edges out other beholdable options by a significant margin. The top of the voyage ranks are loaded with DIP/SCI, but being able to build-a-bear your way to a strong crew has value on its own and is far preferable to a paltry amount of honor.
