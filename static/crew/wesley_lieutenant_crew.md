While we were running around wearing masks and getting vaccination certificates, 2021 unleashed another more insidious plague; four Wesley Events. He nearly doubled his variant Event tally in a single year and does have a few Traits that will likely provide future chances for him to flex his awful Bases on weekend Shuttles.

Usable Evasion on Ships exists for Wesley superfans, but thatâ€™s where the good news ends until we get a [whatever Trait] Collection down the line. If you want to get an A, pass on Wes.
