A name that conjures images of the S.S. Minnow fares slightly better in practice. Lacking cadet mission utility is a huge bummer, but he has enough trait-y, collection-y appeal to catch the eye of players at all levels while offering usable base and voyage metrics for the early game.

He’s certainly not an essential name and you’ll probably want to get your weekend cadet crew in order first, but throw in some of his galaxy map node unlocks and he’s a fine leveling project after that.
