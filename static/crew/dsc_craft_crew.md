New crew usually bring a little bit of excitement as to what their stats can bring to new players sadly our Craft here is aptly stranded among the average cards. His SEC base will bring a bit of power to shuttles if you are missing some of the bigger players. Whilst his voyage totals are fair substantial, don't expect his common combination of skills to be included over the multitudes of other, more useful crew. Consider The Viceroy or Boxer Chakotay for stronger alternatives.
