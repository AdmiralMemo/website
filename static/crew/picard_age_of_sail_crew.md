"I always knew this day would come." You may have to walk the 6-pack plank (You'll never make it...no one ever has) to snag this skipper, but as a crew, he's worth it.

With but a single commendation to his name (meritorious vanity collection), you'll be hoisting Picard up the star counts to tap into his voyage potential (top score for his skill order) and base/event pairing. A DIP base triple digit points higher than any other Picard makes him an excellent option for shuttles, bonus or not.

Picard events have yet to experience their expected uptick in the wake of his namesake show's season 1 and his traits are less than exemplary, but Picard remains a fairly reliable and anticipated event name moving forward.
