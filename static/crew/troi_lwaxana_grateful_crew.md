As with most four year old Legendary Crew, Lwaxana has little left to offer outside of the sum of her Traits. As of yet we are Grateful she has hit on a single Diplomat Trait for a Collection, but we would be remiss if we didn’t take it with a little grain of salt, since unfortunately the rest of her Traits may have too much overlap with existing Collections (Telepath and Ambassador), too big to be viable (Romantic) or a racial Collection that would almost entirely be the Lwaxana and Deanna Troi Show™. Take this crew in a Legendary Behold with low expectations.
