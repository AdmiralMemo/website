As with most four year old Legendary Crew, Lwaxana has little left to offer outside of the sum of her Traits. We are certainly Grateful that WRG decided to drop the Deanna and Lwaxana, err I mean Betazoid, Collection. Unfortunatelty, since the rest of her Traits may have too much overlap with existing Collections (Telepath and Ambassador), or be too big to be viable (Romantic, Civilian, and Federation), hoping for anything else at this point is just being greedy, so keep that in mind when she pops up in a Behold.
