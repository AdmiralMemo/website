There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Tierless Zone.

Frankly, it's a profanity to attempt to rank a crew such as Koosh ball. There's too big a gulf in value from playstyle to playstyle and what Tribble offers is a series of peaks and valleys. He (yes, there's a hidden male trait) won't voyage for you or ever set foot in the arena, yet there's a certain level of flexibility for a crew who dominates ten of the eleven shuttle seats for which they're eligible.

If your experience with one-skill wonder Bones has been positive, ask your doctor if Captain Tribble is right for you. There's a small bump in base power comparatively and a nearly three-to-one edge for CMD seating over MED on event shuttles. As a 'screwdriver' crew, Tribble is a situational powerhouse. You just have to decide if shuttles are the situation in which you want to succeed.
