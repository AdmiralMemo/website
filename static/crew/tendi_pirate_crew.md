Joining the ranks of bare midriff crew in the game (Collection when?) Pirate Tendi is a strong Super Rare with fantastic art, a plus Skill set, and enough Voyage power and Traits to take full advantage. Joining Mariner’s Holodeck program, D’Vana enjoys a quartet of Collections, which is likely her ceiling, and a MED Base that will play for infrequent seating chances on Event Shuttles, variant and Trait-based bonuses both.
