For a very long time, Captain Braxton stood alone atop the Voyage ranks, despite disparaging words from a certain silken-haired Big Book of Behold Advice contributor. Alas, time and Power Creep comes for them all, even this noted Temporal Agent. Does that make it ironic? Poetic justice? Who knows.

No longer the juggernaut that would appear on 75% of your Voyages due to overwhelming power, Brax still has the legs to make at least some of them; Voyage viable for the majority of players, you may not want to start him from scratch because by the time you have him finished, he may no longer be Voyage viable at all.

However, at one star he can still find himself on a few Gauntlet teams when Crit aligns; WRG still hasn’t printed a large number of crew in his Skill set that are “good at Gauntlet”. His Traits are also mostly untapped as of this writing; look for Braxton to hit a Collection ceiling of four while you slowly add stars to him via Behold or Crew Retrieval.
