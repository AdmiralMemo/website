Physician heal thyself...oh wait this incarnation of Bashir can’t, because he isn’t. The missing trait aside he’s quite the unique card, sporting the only SCI/MED/SEC combination in the game, which gives him some unique use cases. Coming in high up on the SCI/MED charts is his best feature but having that SEC tertiary would certainly make thinking about seating arrangements on your next MED SEC outing. His arena attack bonus at 6 seconds is also quite appealing but not an essential feature. Now if we could just get a Badda Bing collection combined with the missing trait, then we’d be talking about a must have crew.
