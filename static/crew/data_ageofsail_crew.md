A nice change of pace from all the ENG primary Datas, AoS leverages a variant-best CMD for fairly regular event work. His smattering of traits and a new Picard-themed TV show should help him rebound from a slow 2019. A chunk of arena damage always catches the eye, but the unfortunate combination of trigger and poor passive stats brings him in a hair behind more available options like Covert Leland or Survivalist Kirk.
