A nice change of pace from all the ENG Primary Datas, AoS leverages a variant-best CMD for fairly regular Event work. His smattering of Traits and a penchant for WRG to call his number for variant Events will keep him busy on the weekend. Heâ€™s also a fine choice for Beholds and Crew Retrieval, as the aforementioned smattering of Traits have given him three non-Vanity Collections plus two more possible ones hidden somewhere in that costume.
