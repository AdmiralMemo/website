He's got one Skill - no one should be surprised at discovering he's a bad card, but he's certainly not the worst card. He has a few notable offerings while some cards can't even claim one good attribute.

Scotty is primarily an Arena and Skirmish asset who hits the trifecta of strong Boost (+9 Accuracy), fast Activation (four seconds), and the best Passive Stats in the game. Heaps and oodles of Crit, Accuracy, and Evasion make him formidable there. If you want to flex on some fools with an OG Trek hero, well, hereâ€™s to ya, lad.
