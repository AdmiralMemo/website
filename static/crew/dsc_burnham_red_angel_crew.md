Gauntlet Goddess. RA's huge proficiency total includes a beefy secondary ENG roll to help put The Caretaker in his place for ENG/SCI and ENG/DIP matchups and in concert with a staggering number of elevated crit gauntlets, makes her the most dependable gauntlet crew in the game. She and Locutus are the only two crew who can truly dominate multiple skill pairs at once in the majority of gauntlets and is a 'Bank error in your favor. Collect 200 points.' when she hits 45% crit. Even competent handling of a third pair in SCI/DIP is possible in some cases, giving her unrivaled skill pair coverage.

Beyond gauntlet, Burnham's second step is not a doozy like Balok or Armus. She holds up very well on voyages with a worthwhile overall score and seven different anti-matter traits. Her set of collections is an immediate roster-wide bump thanks to the Gauntlet collection's exclusivity and with Burnham's clockwork event bonuses, makes her an understandable citation candidate if you're not particularly lucky in the gauntlet. And, oh yea, her art is pretty frickin' cool. If you're reading this because she just dropped for you in the gauntlet, congratulations - you're in for a ride.
