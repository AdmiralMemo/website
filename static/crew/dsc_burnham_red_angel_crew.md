Oh heavenly deity I pray to you that one may do thine bidding. For I have forsaken thee and all thy proficiencies. Grant unto me thy daily merits so that I may acquire thee and look upon your visage with love. Amen.

It has been a long, long time since a Gauntlet update happened and the illustrious Armus left a long sticky trail all the way back to 2018. And out of the darkness comes a shining angel that has made all but the most vocal Gauntlet haters giddy with anticipation. We expect the Gauntlet crew, when they come about, to have big numbers in proficiencies but Red Angel delivers the right combination of high bases and high minimum rolls to put her voyage averages straight into the Top 20 voyage crew. She sits right next to Interfaced LaForge, Leah Brahms and Honey Bare pushing them out of “must-cite” lists.

Compared to other Gauntlet mainstays, she’s probably most likely to upset the walls of Locutus along the way and even take a few Caretakers down too. It’s a cascade effect as people scramble to get crew to combat the new hotness and I hope Red Angel’s inclusion into the top ranks of Gauntlet means we get to see some variation in builds as opposed to the usual motley crew of The Boggy Bartender Banjo Borg.

Her trait list is somewhat insane, sporting a ton of useful features that have not only been Gauntlet bonuses for a while but are oft repeated on events. And speaking of events, she’s a Burnham and you know what that means. That’s right, until Discovery suddenly gets whisked off air by Anson Mount’s fanbase she is going to remain relevant for a very, very long time.
