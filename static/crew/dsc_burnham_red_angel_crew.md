This Burnham variant put the entire game on notice when she debuted and made her first order of business chomping a huge bite out of a previous Gauntlet Exclusive in The Caretaker. Outright stealing an Exclusive’s best pair is unheard of and she doesn’t stop there - also ruling over the DIP/ENG options and nearly going blow for blow with the DIP/SCI leader. She has incredible coverage flexibility and along with Locutus is one of two crew who can truly dominate multiple Skill pairs at once in the majority of Gauntlets.

Acting as a 'Bank error in your favor - Collect 200 points' when she hits 45% crit, Red Angel also owns an incredible two score of 25%+ Crit Gauntlets. She may not reach Balok’s absurd level of “Take him and his four dupes” with his myriad 65% Crit gauntlets, but she has a higher, safer floor than any other Gauntlet crew and every roster should be so lucky as to win her early on in their Timelines journey to stabilize that area of play.

Beyond Gauntlet, Burnham's second step is not a doozy like Balok or Armus. Her set of Collections is an immediate roster-wide bump thanks to the Gauntlet Collection's exclusivity and she enjoys Burnham's clockwork Event bonuses. And, oh yea, her art is pretty frickin' cool. If you're reading this because she just dropped for you in the Gauntlet, congratulations - you're in for a ride.
