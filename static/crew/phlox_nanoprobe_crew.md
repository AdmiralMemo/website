Let’s talk for a moment about value for money. Is having another ENG/MED card on your roster worth the 100k honor despite the competition from giveaways Medic Reno and Gauntlet mainstay The Caretaker? Damned straight he is. 

In order to have any real depth in ENG/MED these days, you would have either had to throw a bunch of dilithium down on a Tuesday pack or have ranked well in a certain event to grab that combo. Even if you were fortunate to grab a Caretaker during a lucky, yet somehow frequently occurring, three streak combo in the Gauntlet, you will find he compliments Phlox as perfectly as a fine bottle of 2153 Nanoprobe Merlot goes with a Denobulan red blood cell count shandy. 

Phlox sits higher than newcomers Doctor Van Gogh and Torpedo McCoy for MED/ENG/SCI scores overall, and unless you have been lucky and scored yourself a Cheesecake Seven, then he’s going to be top of those leagues in your roster for quite a while. The fact that such a strong card is available for free that the days of ENG/MED exclusivity is over.
