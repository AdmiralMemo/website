It's fair to say that we've entered something of a new stage in the game - a stage in which underpopulated skill sets are regularly filled out, and in which you have to be a little more choosy about who you pick to represent these once elusive skill combinations. Between the Caretaker, Reno, Indulgent Seven and Van Gogh, there's a good few high caliber picks for this voyage combo that offer different things, and come with different price tags.

Phlox is definitely one of the priciest, depending on your luck in Beholds or Gauntlet streaks, and he's definitely what you'd call a calculated investment, but the numbers all come up good when you punch them in. He is THE #1 ENG base for every single one of his traits, including the Borg, Physician, Exobiology, Phlox and Enterprise event pools, and his MED base is meaty enough to find work in the same pools. 

His dual collections are among the easiest in the game, but both could easily be expanded, and while he may lag slightly behind his aforementioned ENG/MED fellows for raw voyage score, he actually contributes more to that skill pairing than anyone but Medic Reno - something to keep in mind, considering he also has a good number of bonus traits that'll net you bonus voyage antimatter. As a result, he complements the others as fantastically and as piquantly as a fine bottle of 2153 Nanoprobe Merlot goes with a Denobulan blood cell count.

Is he worth the price? It's a question only you can answer, taking into account your roster needs and your luck - after all, it's all very well talking up the other options, but if you can't get them, so what? Phlox is available for a fixed price, always. If you got Medic Reno in her giveaway, I can understand skepticism given Phlox's price point, but you can't fill out a voyage with just one card, and if you find yourself needing to diversify your roster, there are few ways to do it quite so quickly or reliably. And let's face it, 100,000 Honor might very well end up cheap, compared to trying to chase down a 'better' option in a Tuesday six pack.
