It’s a real shame that this art is buried in the Uncommon ranks while the Matzo cracker Kamala snags a spot in the legendary ranks. It’s also a shame that both variants are pretty poor. Betrothed has it better, all things considered, but a painfully thin trait set undercuts her usefulness mightily. 

Eligible for just two days of cadet work each week, her secondary skill has trouble critting nodes there and WRG is unlikely to backfill Kriosian node bonuses any time soon. Kamala’s arena “hammer” is an interesting consideration, but can be used unleveled, which is welcome news for a crew whose collection value is as thin as Alrik of Valt’s interest in gorgeous women.
