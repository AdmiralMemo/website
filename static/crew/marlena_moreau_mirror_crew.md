Players still using Super Rares on Voyages will find Marlena useful if they happen across a Fully Fused version, but the cupboard isn't exactly stocked otherwise. A single Collection which should double before too long looks to be the extent of her value in that area.

With some low-level Event possibilities hinging on two Traits, Marlena is a "smoke 'em if you got 'em" type of card who should be utilized early on in your Timelines journey and then put on ice.
