Geordi's voyage work is still on par with new 4/4 or 1/5 releases, but most of his post-fusion goodness comes in the form of double collections, a smattering of traits to provide some weekend opportunities, and being one of only two DIP options for La Forge events. Just don't forget to search for him when thawing variants for an event.
