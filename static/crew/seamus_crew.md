Let's be honest here, in the future when you look back at all the great characters to grace your crew roster, the strange Irish hologram brandishing his book of "Faerie Magick" is one probably best forgotten, much like the episode he hails from.

His obscurity matches his rankings and he sports an incredibly lacklustre DIP/SEC combination with voyage numbers too deep in the drink to even consider talking about. He sold his decent traits for another bottle of booze and sits in the long queue of DIP crew waiting for a seat on a shuttle that will never come. Saints preserve us and send him on his way.
