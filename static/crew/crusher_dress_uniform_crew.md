Bev has never been (and likely will never be) a big Event player, but still, she does own competent Bases, a few viable Traits, and main cast crew status to make her a probable Thaw candidate some time in the future when you least expect it. Two Collections in hand and one in the bush offers a little something to help boost the rest of your roster if you're not big on Faction Events.
