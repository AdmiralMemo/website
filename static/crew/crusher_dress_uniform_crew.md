Big Book janitor and spreadsheet syntax enthusiast Captain Idol lobbied hard for a tier 10 ranking for Bev, which should give you an idea of the sort of stretches of uselessness she potentially offers your roster. 

Bev has never been (and likely will never be) an event player - even Whizz kid Wes almost doubles mom's event tally. But despite the thinnest collection value possible, she does own competent bases, a few potentially eventable traits, and theoretical bridge crew status, making her a probably thaw candidate some time in the future when you least expect it.
