Listen, if you are the subservient benefactor of a literal god's patronage you would by proxy get some power vested to you. Suspiria might be bad at anger management, but sheâ€™s quite good at picking her administrators. I always like to see unique skill sets in Super Rare crew as it automatically gives them a pass for usefulness. Needless to say, anyone with the rare MED/SEC skillset will be somewhat useful to most rosters. Tanis knocks Combat Medic Paris from the top spot for shuttle seats and even sits fairly high on the DIP/MED rankings. He gets a +1 for an easy diplomat collection filler. While a lack of traits and variant events mean his number might not get called often, he will be useful every day getting things done. Such as being a sociopath, demonstrating superiority and handing over a starship's complement of crew for pure revenge. Well, nobody's perfect...
