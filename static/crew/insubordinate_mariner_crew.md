Bat’leth gives MED, flask gives ENG…write that down, write that down. Not nearly as meme-able as “I LOVE HON-OR” from the same scene, Flask Mariner is stock standard in more ways than one.

Competent but not interesting on Shuttles and Voyages, you may be coming across this Mariner as a candidate for a 5th star missing from her Mega Event over a year old now, or finding her freshly as a new crew to you from a Behold. Until her untapped Traits bear more Collection fruit, you may want to consider passing her up in favor of a crew with more immediate or better long-term value.
