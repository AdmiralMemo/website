I'll level with you, there are times when I almost want to downplay how good a card is because I want to try and game the system, get fewer people to compete in events, just so I can have a better shot at them. I've never done it, but boy have I been tempted. And Ezri is the latest in a very small line to tempt me.

Boasting enough raw voyage power to outperform geezers like Koloth, though not the skill set to truly pull ahead of silver foxes like Tainer, Ezri manages to outpace even that pack thanks to lots of little tasty fringe benefits. For one, she's one of the few top shelf voyagers that you'll actually recognise at a glance (Leucon? Boothby Replicant?), meaning she grandfathers her way into a Dax-sized event count. So far, so Fancy, Dan.

Ezri also manages to slide into home plate with the crown of new #1 Dax SEC (stolen from the withering Mirror Jadzia), meaning she corners the market on some of the more common shuttle seats. She also comes bundled with a useable +9 Attack at 6 seconds on ships, and a hard to complete vanity with some truly despicable cards that you don't want to immortalise before her (I'd like to refer you to the excellently written Solok write-up down in the Super Rare section, I hear the author is quite handsome and well-endowed).

She does have her downsides - mediocre traits outside of Athlete, Counselor and Costumed, none of which I like the chances of, and she's still a SEC/DIP voyager at the heart of things, her MED only a sad tertiary - but numbers like these age like a fine wine, not unlike Nicole de Boer herself. So snag yourself a copy while you can, and enjoy some Scotch gum.
