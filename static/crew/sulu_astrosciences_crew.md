Long time players might recall Astro's hilarious introduction to the game via a 10,000 dil buy-in weekday Pack. He's been disappointing players who paid that amount every day since. 

A respectable SCI Proficiency might trick players into taking him for the Gauntlet and while he can edge out a few wins at 45% Crit, his other Proficiencies are miniscule and the CMD/DIP/SCI skill set has an avalanche of competition. A couple Events per year and average Collection value for a Legendary Crew finish off the outline for what is one in a long line of disappointing Sulu variants. If youâ€™re lucky, Sulu might eke out a trio of Stat-boosting Collections before the heat death of the Timelines universe.
