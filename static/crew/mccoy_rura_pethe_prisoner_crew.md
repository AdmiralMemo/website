Rura Penthe McCoy will give you some very early game Gauntlet wins over even newer players who are still using Common and Uncommon Crew, but doesnâ€™t offer a lot else other than a MED Base skill for cracking Galaxy Map and Cadet Mission Nodes wide open. Take the notches on his two Stat-boosting Collections and look for some MED from Super Rares and Legendaries after that.
