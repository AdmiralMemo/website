That cute little oil slick from Mario Kart sure has come a long way. Now he's all grown up and a great choice to blue shell any of your opponents who may be bananas about the Gauntlet. 

Armus was the Featured Exclusive for a very long time so you may have collected fistfuls of him and may have even kept a duplicate or two or three, but unfortunately his competition has edged him into a “take sometimes/rarely” team member from a “take always” star.

Armus still has the top CMD/SCI roll in ten gauntlets, and the top SCI/SEC in three, but it’s crowded at the top of those ranks given new Exclusives with crit sets tailored to their Traits. 

Of course, if you don’t have a copy, snag him from a Gauntlet Behold if you can and Fully Equip him, and take him to Gauntlet once or twice a fortnight. He probably isn’t worth Citations given his low ancillary attributes, which are being a non-starter on Voyages, Events, on Ships, or inclusion in many Collections.
