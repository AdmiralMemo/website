It’s always common for a new card to rock up and replace some long forgotten cite-bait as the new flavour of the moment. This time it’s Age Of Sail Crusher’s turn to be the victim to her shipmates' slightly shinier sails. I guess Crusher hates Tomatoes, or Bunnycorn, or judgemental yet highly accurate and damning opinions.

Nobody that’s been playing in the last year should be lacking any number of DIP/MED options. Two of the top ten were mega giveaways and whilst Troi might have enough power in numbers to come close to Reverend Phlox’s combination of skills she doesn’t have quite the same utility. And whilst she qualifies for a Gauntlet combo it’s not a huge advantage over  Bartender Guinan and the walls of El-Aurians.

The short of it is that unless you’ve been woeful in your daily duties you should be well equipped with DIP/MED already, and if you haven’t then Troi is unlikely to make much of a difference should some new flavour of the moment come out...And if you are a new player, stop looking at the Tuesday packs! Bad new player! Nice event count though.
