If any character deserves the Caregiver Trait, it’s absolutely Raffi. The Canadian singer/songwriter gave joy to millions of kids for many decades. Wait…what? They gave it to Raffi Musiker? Raffi “I don't think you understand just how much it sucked to be your kid” Musiker? Raffi “Tell me what was worth ignoring me and Dad until we hardly recognized you” Musiker?

All that aside… what do we want from our Super Rares, kids? (pause for response) That’s right, Collections and Events! 

Raffi’s got a likely ceiling of two… oh wait, she’s already hit two Collections? Well, that’s not good. At least she’s got a DIP-led Skill set so when Raffi variant Events or Trait-based bonuses hit, she can find a place to plop her bottom and her duffel bag on your Shuttles.
