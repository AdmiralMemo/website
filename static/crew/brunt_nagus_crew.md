Lord Brunt, formerly of the FCA, has come to audit your collections and has found them wanting. Luckily, you've found the cure for what ails you and we're not talking about boiled Tube Grub extract. The Diplomat and Cultural Figure groups are plenty large while legendary Ferengi worth immortalizing are few and far between. He should hit the Yahtzee to turn all of his traits into stat-boosting goodness, but is worth the acquisition even before then. 

Unfortunately his daily work in the early game is minimal at best. The Ferengi qualifies for Sunday cadet missions (the lobes are a dead giveaway), but only his DIP is suitable for Epic difficulty and won't make much of an impact elsewhere. If you've not run many Ferengi shuttles, you'll be at the mercy of your replicator to finish a build cost that includes fistfuls of Faction items, including over thirty Ferengi trade by-laws. What can we say? The guy knows his profit margins.
