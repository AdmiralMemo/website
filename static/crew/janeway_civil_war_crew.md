I know that you're probably asking yourself, why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like Janeway? The answer: Q is an early game player.

Satisfactory voyage power to compliment Janeway's plus skill set would be a nice boost to newer players' voyages, if she weren't a 6-pack crew. And a strong-for-MED primary base pairs well with an event name which has caught a huge percentage of Faction weekends to date.

There's a bit of a gulf in value between how newer and older players look at her, but Q's side chick is fairly formidable for players just starting out and should merit thaw consideration for veterans and newbies alike.
