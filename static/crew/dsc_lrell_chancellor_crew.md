L'rell's last note was a warning about her DIP primary, bland skill set as a whole, and a massive Disco event bubble that may pop at any time. Since then, she did pick up yet another four weeks of bonus, but during a mega which saw two new crew with better utility exceed her Disco DIP base. If you have her partially fused, keep starring up a crew who still has respectable metrics and a better than average chance at events. But if you're coming new to L'Rell, her thin utility elsewhere, highlighted by a bad skill set, may not make her the best choice if you're looking for something other than an event piece or a better-than-average Diplomat to cite up for that elusive stat bonus.
