Objectively one of the top four crew in the game with “Professor” in their name, this Super Rare variant has little to offer the player outside of art from a hilarious moment in ST: IV and perhaps two Collections. Scotty Events are sparse and his light Trait list gives him few options to cash in on Trait bonus Events.
