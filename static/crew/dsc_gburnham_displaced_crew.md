Despite the temptation, we can’t really steal Eddington’s “two Skills, one airlock” tagline in this case since WRG gave Burnmom a more-than-respectable Trait list. Aside from her very Joran Belar Sisko artwork, you’re looking at card value driven by Trait-fueled Collections and Event work.

Discovery Mega Events notwithstanding, Gabbi’s Event history has held solid. With usable Base metrics, she should be able to pitch in on a few weekends each year. The rest of the intrigue lies in her Collection ceiling of seven, plus even a few pie-in-the-sky options to push it even higher. If you’re at the point in the game in which global Stat boosts from Collections is your bag, baby, select her from your Legendary Behold or put her on your Crew Retrieval list.
