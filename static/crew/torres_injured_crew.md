Family Guy Knee Gag Torres parlays a Trait lineup that would make Spock blush into a fistful of Collections with room for more, making her an essential Immortalization for players at every level. Beyond that, Cadet Eligibility throughout the week and a massive Combined ENG should have her unlocking Cadet Missions with ease. She may even earn some use on Ships as a strong, albeit brief defensive option.
