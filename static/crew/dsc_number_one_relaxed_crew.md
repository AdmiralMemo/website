She is the very model of a tired, worn-out skill set.

The numbers look pretty good, and if Discovery megas still include the whole gang or a Pike series launches, Number One can be very handy for many weekends to come.That said, read Riker Odan's note if you want a deeper dive on the subject, but Una Paloma Blanca is the fourth character out of the last seven to feature some combination of a CMD/DIP/SCI skill set. Consider this the BBoBA's official request to the powers that be to move onto something else for a while.
