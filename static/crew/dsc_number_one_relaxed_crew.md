See Odan, Riker for some additional ranting about the skill set, but CMD/DIP/SCI has been WRG's pet project for far too long - perhaps unavoidably as a pivot from CMD/DIP/SEC. Number One's strong voyage power is unfortunately stuck in a bad skill set marriage making her pop on younger rosters, but will see her replaced much sooner than some more exotic combinations. Still, the raw power in an important area of the game coupled with the Discovery and/or Strange New Worlds relevance bump should give you chances to put her strong diplomacy base to use in spurts.
