Does a character without a name really qualify for the Janeway/Picard 'character look left, character smiling' variant treatment? Regardless, she's here now and not as bad as she could have been.

There's some bad news hiding behind an otherwise reasonable Event count - it's inflated by prior Discovery Mega Event domination, unlikely to be repeated. It's not out of the realm of possibility for Strange New Worlds to change that, but no show has really elevated crew’s Event chances like the first installation of “Nu Trek”.

Four viable Traits is enough meat on the bone for a Super Rare crew, and she could (and should) end up as a more attractive card to endgame players than she debuted as.
