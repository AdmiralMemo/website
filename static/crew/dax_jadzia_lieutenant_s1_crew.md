Sporting the top Common SCI Base and a whopping four Collections, this is a card worth leveling up ASAP even if you arenâ€™t a massive Jadzia fan. Even her ENG stat can help get through a few of the early missions. Nothing amazing about her ship ability or anything else, but what more do you want?!
