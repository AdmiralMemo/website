Continuing the trend of Uber-Campaign crew being luxurious but ultimately inessential, Pupway springs onto the scene as a curious beast - unique enough among variants to stand out and snag Voyage seats they couldn't even dream of staffing, but also just a little too weird to be of use where those variants usually shine, i.e. your annual quota of Janeway Shuttles. The Skill set is definitely nice, if a bit baffling, but while it impressed at Crufts' exclusive Voyager category, it's the mangy mutt of Faction usage; Janeway simply doesn't have enough MED to ensure Event seats that only this particular Kathryn can staff, and for someone with Janeway's pedigree, that's a problem.

Since her debut, PupWayâ€™s Skill set has been refreshed thrice, which lends itself to burying this crew well down the Voyage ranks. Long-term value remains in her Collection profile; a Vanity Collection, and a ceiling of a trio of Stat-Boosting Collections gives her slightly-above average marks for those who added the fifth star.
