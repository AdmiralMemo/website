The rare reward for a mission in Episode 10, Quinn is a base and voyage powerhouse. His event future isn't all that promising with no variants and a trait set esoteric enough to make an interior decorator blush, but with daily use numbers like Quinn boasts, he might not need them. The #2 CMD/DIP/SEC voyage score and a huge DIP base will garner him about as much work as he can handle on any roster. The pitfalls of CMD/DIP/SEC one-off crew are very well documented, but he's also a statistical force who beams himself and an ad-warped copy onto your ship for free.
