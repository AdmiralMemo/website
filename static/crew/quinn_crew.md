The rare reward for a mission in Episode 10, Quinn is a base and voyage powerhouse. His event future isn't all that promising with no variants and a trait set esoteric enough to make an interior decorator blush, but with daily use numbers like Quinn boasts, he might not need them. Since his debut, he's climbed down from the #2 CMD/DIP/SEC voyage score down to a still impressive #5, which you should take as a cautionary toward investing too heavily in raw power over skill set, but a huge DIP base will garner him about as much work as he can handle on any roster, especially considering the lack of any DIP primary mega crew thus far. The pitfalls of CMD/DIP/SEC one-off crew are very well documented, but he's also a statistical force who beams himself and an ad-warped copy onto your ship for free.
