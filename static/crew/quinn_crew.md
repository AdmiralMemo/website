The rare reward for a mission in Episode 10, Quinn (still) offers some meaty base and voyage power. His event future isn't all that promising with no variants and a trait set eclectic enough to make an interior decorator blush, but with daily use numbers like Quinn boasts, he might not need them.

His avilability makes him a priority choice as the one legendary crew needed to finish the stat-boosting Continuum collection and his numbers should keep him in service on shuttles and voyages for some time to come. The pitfalls of CMD/DIP/SEC one-off crew are very well documented, but he's also a statistical force who beams himself and an ad-warped copy onto your ship for free.
