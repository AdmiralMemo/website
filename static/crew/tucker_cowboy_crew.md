NS Tucker is a blend of interesting attributes and ineffective numbers. His vaguely top ten ENG and ENG/DIP rolls ultimately result in him being clowned on by The Red Angel, as most crew are. However, a Simpsons handful of 45% Crit sets give him enough power to bring along occasionally and he is able to match the featured Skill in three of the four instances.

Formerly a Voyager (when we walked to school in the snow uphill both ways), Tucker shouldn't be used in that capacity any longer despite his myriad Anti-matter traits. But because that Skill set is generally low power overall, it's a good combo to keep tucked away in the back of your brain for future releases.

The last stop on this wagon train to the lower tiers is naturally the Event/Collection combo. Trip's Bases are flat out bad, but he does get just enough Event love from WRG and has a number of Traits that could and should provide many more bonuses. Similarly, he's already a well-above average Collection value even if we ignore his Vanity and a few Traits waiting in the wings will keep him a buoyant, if not overall powerful Behold option.
