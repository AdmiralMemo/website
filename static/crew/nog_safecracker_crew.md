Don't let his name subliminally influence you - Nog is a fairly risky investment. "Good enough" debut voyage power is now in the range where your weekly gold is likely to outperform him with star one and the number of Ferengi in the game these days make him non-essential for his collection, even if he's still one of the better super rare options.

As for events and the chance to utilize Nog's strong ENG base - the optimist would say that we haven't had a Ferengi mega yet, the pessimist would say that he's had one bonus in over two years. So...is the vault half empty or half full?
