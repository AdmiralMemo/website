Good ol’ Noggles here is, much like the character he represents, a card with hidden depths. On the surface, he’s infrequent event crew more suited for daily shuttles than he is anything else, with a decent-but-not great 6 second +7 Accuracy boost in the Arena, but if you take the time to work those locks and really study the contents, you’ll see a hidden value here. This particular Nog, is the singular Ferengi in the game with SCI. No, I don’t count Dr. Reyga, thank you. His work on metaphasic shielding has been discredited by the scientific community. Okay, fine, only 4* and above Ferengi with SCI.

Now, on the surface of things, that may not seem like much, but you gotta have faith in the Great Material Continuum. A Ferengi mega feels like it’s been in the offing for a while now, and to have the entire market cornered on a skill, well. It’s a lot more than a lot of 4* crew can offer, I can tell you that. He may not set the world on fire, but he’s certainly unique, and sometimes, that’s all it takes.
