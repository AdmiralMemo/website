A unique dual-eligibility crew, Data Q qualifies for both of those characters’ events. Going forward, that means that he’s a shuttle-worthy SCI base for both characters and has collected a significant event tally to date. His spot in a stat-boosting collection which needs all its super rares helps make him a behold priority even if you're not fussed with faction events. With little of interest on the periphery, Data Q is merely fine for daily play, but should be costing you bundles of merits to thaw for Faction events down the line.
