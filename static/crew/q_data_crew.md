A unique dual-eligibility crew, Data Q qualifies for both of those characters’ events. Going forward, that means that he’s the #2 SCI base for both characters and has collected a significant event tally to date. His five second attack boost on ships may carve out a niche in the ship battle speed up era, but is a bit weaker than can be found elsewhere. With little of interest on the periphery, Data Q is merely fine for daily play, but should be costing you bundles of merits to thaw for Faction events down the line.
