An Event/Collection piece like hundreds of other Legendary crew, Mariachi is fine to take a star on here or there in a poor Legendary Behold and you should keep an eye on the count and size of his Collections to see how he stacks up against your other options.

A fun bit of niche usability - his lone 65% Gauntlet sees him with the top DIP/SEC roll over a 5% Locutus, if you've ever wanted to help Q get his revenge against the irascible Jean-Luc.
