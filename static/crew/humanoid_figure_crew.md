Like a story told out of sequence, lost to the depths of the Temporal Cold War, Scott Darkula emerged from the 28th century with stats that look more like 2019. We look to the recurring mega crew to be the exemplary performer for our efforts of participating every week. Some have been excellent, some have been dire. Some make up for middling numbers with a must-have ship ability or find use in the gauntlet. Shadowy Bastard has none of that and, despite bearing Archer's face, lacks the Archer variant tag that could give him enduring event utility.

Not-Archer here sits in the middle ground of being either a fine addition to your collection or redundant due to citing choices in the past. If you supported the Campaign or are an event hoarder, chances are you have Scrooge Data or New Eden Pike in your rosters to call on for better alternatives. Even as a rare example of a DIP main mega recurring, Future Guy still doesnâ€™t quite stand high enough to beat previous mega rewards that share his skillset: Picard And Number One and Timekeeper Tenavik. The best you can say is that he is not bad, average, middle of the road. But lacking the expected Archer variant tag and sporting a poor set of traits, the best he will do in the future is fade into history.
