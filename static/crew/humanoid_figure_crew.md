Like a story told out of sequence, lost to the depths of the Temporal Cold War, Scott Darkula emerged from the 28th century with Stats that look more like the 18th century. We look to the Recurring Mega Event Legendary crew to be the exemplary performer for our efforts of participating every week. Some have been excellent, some have been dire. Some make up for middling numbers with a must-have Ship Ability or find use in the Gauntlet. Shadowy Bastard has none of that and, despite bearing Archer's face, lacks the Archer variant tag that could give him enduring event utility.

If you were playing during his Mega Event and listened to disaffected veterans who said he’s not worth the citation, you probably don’t feel too bad about that decision. 

That being said, just about every crew has some kind of value in the form of Trait bonuses for Events and Collections - potential or realized. With an art asset file of the Hologram Collection having teased the online community for a long time and a reasonable spread of eclectic Traits, Totally-Not-Archer should enjoy a small climb back up the value charts in time as his Traits trigger upticks in value once his daily use ability has fallen off completely.
