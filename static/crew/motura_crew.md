The third legendary Vidiian crew is hardly a Goldilocks. Arguably less useful than his four and eight year older counterparts, Motura promises much on the back of his valuable skill set, but unfortunately his beauty is only skin deep. 

As has been detailed in many notes throughout the Book, voyage efficacy hinges on the confluence of power and uniqueness via skills and traits. The former alone can make or break voyagers and without it, you often find crew who look appealing at their maxed out stats, but end up only incremental upgrades or a disappointing use of citations. So while Motura has a smattering of number one metrics due to his nearly one-of-a-kind skill order, he’s not the hole plugger you’ve been waiting on.

He may also struggle to make an impact on the weekends where a spotty event history meets a skill order which doesn’t find favorable Faction seating opportunity. When factoring in his debut collection value, there are certainly parts of Motura to like, such as his Talaxian lung and Kazon nose. But he boasts the hallmarks of a crew whose workload will not endure like most of the game’s top names.
