David Duchovny has the good fortune of collecting the Mirror trait (and associated traits) to boost his event count up into double-digits. With Mirror SEC stacked with equally unappealing options, you'd technically not be wrong to take him in a pinch for that reason, since it's not like the other cards are much better or worse.

Even still, you'll be feeling the Begold remorse pretty soon unless he manages to get lucky with traits, since Reed events are stuck in the mud, leaving two variant-best bases rotting away. 375% arena damage is a big torpedo, but getting to 12 seconds alive is increasingly difficult these days. Still a valuable Skirmish piece until you're able to acquire faster options. He is, like many others, a bit player waiting on events and not quite able to contribute otherwise on some rosters.
