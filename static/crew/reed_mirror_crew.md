David Duchovny has the good fortune of collecting the Mirror Universe Trait (and other associated Traits) to boost his Event count, since just being Malcom ain’t doing him any favors in the eyes of WRG.

Flashing a few other niche uses, his 375% Instant Damage on Ships is a big torpedo, but getting to twelve seconds alive is increasingly difficult these days. And his trio of 45% Gauntlets combined with something vaguely reminiscent of a strong Gauntlet pair might help balm the wound of having to take him early on in a bad Behold.

Realistically, you’re going to forget you own this card after your first couple months in the game, but you have plenty of company in that regard.
