A monster trait and event tally buoys a pair of now-average bases to far more relevance than your average 6-pack flavor of the week crew. He also has a shot at everyday use with the premier defensive ability in the arena for anyone who was lucky enough to miss out on former mega Minuet. Dual collections sound better on paper with one of them being laughably easy to finish and Laborer's lack of voyage work to justify the honor spend, but with such a happy m√©lange of weekend relevance, he's the rare 2-skill gold who's justifiable as a behold choice.
