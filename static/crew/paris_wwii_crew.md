Once upon a time, Paris’ Voyage and Shuttle ability was prettier to look at than Betty Grable’s gams, but nobody beats Father Time, especially with naught but a Colt M1911.

Power creep’s wake hasn’t left much of note beyond a crazy number of big bonus event features. There’s a realistic chance that new players will be able to fuse him up from an event in which case he’d be aces on your roster, but be prepared to freeze him as even unfused Legendary crew begin to edge him out of service. Hang on Brigitte, Bobby’s comin’ home.
