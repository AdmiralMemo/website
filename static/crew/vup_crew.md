Just kind of there; the Mr. Vup crew is pretty proportional to his bully bouncer status on the show. The two points of interest - just OK arena accuracy in the early game and a smattering of traits - are low-impact areas and don't do enough to justify him as a behold choice against an otherwise drab backdrop.

To his credit, a SEC base cresting over 1,000 would merit a thaw should his bad boy traits catch a bonus, but non-guaranteed work relegates Vup to dart-board behold value once you've fleshed out more important parts of your roster.
