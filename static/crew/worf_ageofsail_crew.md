After a few funner Worves in Midwife and EV Suit have finally broken the logjam of CMD/DIP/SEC across his variants, it's easy to dismiss Age of Sail Worf on a superficial scan. But as the man himself would say, the true test of a warrior is not without, it is within.

Despite a Trait list that comes up a bit short, like his appearance on your phone’s screen, he’s got just enough juice to pull a handful of Collections and some weekend bonuses to bolster Worf’s otherwise stable Event history. His common Skill set, which makes him DOA on Voyages at the time of this writing,  gives him a boost on Faction Shuttle seating.

Oh, and one last thing before you go - it's retract plank, not REMOVE plank.
