Roses are red,
Age of Sail Riker isn’t very good but he is charming,
Worf’s lack of variation,
Is truly alarming.
The only thing that'll keep me from self-harming,
During hours of Galaxy item crafting and farming,
Is knowing that Worf is my darling,
And that some DB employee, somewhere, is downing several pints of Carling.

With that charming little ditty out of the way, I have to sadly tell you that Age of Sail Worf is, well . . . less impressive than his hat. He trades Costumed for Governor Worf’s Duelist and Brutal, giving him less than impressive trait chances (Costumed is now swollen far beyond what would be viable for a trait mega), and a voyage score that’s squarely in the very good but not great range. The only thing that could have really saved him is a unique skill set. 

But here we are, with the fourteenth Worf variant who only has some variation of CMD/DIP/SEC. In fact, I take that back - I take umbrage with the idea of this being a variation. This is a palette swap of Governor Worf with very nice art. If you’re a Worf devotee, then he’s worth snagging for the strong SEC base and thoroughly average (for 2020) score, but there’s not much here else that we can’t get elsewhere. That being said, we’re now only two crew away from a full Age of Sail complement, so who knows, he might suddenly become a little valuable in the future...
