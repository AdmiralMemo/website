Whatever dart board DB currently has set up in their office must be weighted heavily for DIP/CMD as Martok is one of 340 (and growing) crew in that entry. Common combination aside Martok is an alright card. The game's second Vulcan mega has put all the possible racial traits back on the event menus, he's comfortably the best Martok variant, and his combination of skills is high enough to be useful for shuttles.

However if you've been playing for a while he won't make Voyages that often unless it's your designated B team during a faction event. An upgrade over Changeling Martok, but not by much, even considering the potato's exclusive vanity collection spot. A shame to waste a good JG Hertzler card...
