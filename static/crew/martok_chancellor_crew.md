Whatever dart board DB currently has set up in their office must be weighted heavily for DIP/CMD as Martok makes the 249th card in that entry. Common combination aside Martok is an alright card. Klingon events come around fairly often and his combination of skills is high enough to be useful for shuttles. However if you've been playing for a while he won't make Voyages that often unless it's your designated B team during a faction event. An upgrade over Changeling Martok but not by much. A shame to waste a good JG Hertzler card...
