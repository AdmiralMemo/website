"This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we crashed." The 23rd century version of Age, Sex, Location doesn't quite hit our pre-warp ears right, but I'm sure that eventually, this'll be cutting edge stuff. Three variants in, and Susan Oliver's Vina continues to be fobbed off with true smokeshow art, but pretty much nothing else, with the constant stuffing of them into six packs meaning you have a better chance of Annorax getting recurrent event bonuses than her. The voyage power is there, but the last thing you should really be doing when you're still using purples for voyages is pulling six packs, especially when a better Super Rare will come across fully fused from an event next week. Ultimately, this is a card for 'elderly' players to finish in the vain hope that we might get a Cage themed vanity at some point - maybe featuring a lovely Picnic Vina we can actually use . . ? Maybe it'll never happen, but we all need our illusions, after all.
