"This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we crashed." The 23rd century version of Age, Sex, Location doesn't quite hit our pre-warp ears right, but I'm sure that eventually, this'll be cutting edge stuff. Three variants in, and Susan Oliver's Vina continues to be fobbed off with true smokeshow art, but pretty much nothing else. 

The Voyage power is there, but by the time you acquire all four copies it may not be. Ultimately, this is a card for 'elderly' players to finish in the vain hope that we might get a The Cage-themed Vanity Collection at some point - maybe featuring a lovely Picnic Vina we can actually use . . ? Maybe it'll never happen, but we all need our illusions, after all.
