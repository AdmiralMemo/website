The name of a (bad) Bond villain, but far less entertaining, you probably shouldn’t bother with Money in most circumstances. The fly in the ointment may be the total lack of SEC-Primary Rare female aliens if you’re trying to 2-for-1 some weekend Cadet Missions value. If you need to level Money to help you Crit some Saturday Nodes, take solace in her two Stat-Boosting Collection spots.
