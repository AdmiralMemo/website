For someone who allows others to voyage across vast distances of time and space, Carl ain't so great at it himself. But that's square peg, round hole territory. The few Trait-match seats he finds on Voyages early on in his lifespan are an ap√©ritif for the main course; Collections. 

Carl has tapped out his Trait list with a five-spot of stat-boosting spots in Collections, and his sizeable Event history, while heavily propped up by Discovery Mega Events, includes help from his Traits to give him the occasional chance to fill ever-present DIP Shuttle seats and avoid a total freeze-and-forget label in the future.
