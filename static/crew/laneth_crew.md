You weren't the only one who had to look up this crew on Memory Alpha, so let's start out with an easy crew comp to the equally impure Klingon Neelix. They have matching SEC scores and rely on a smattering of traits for thawpertunities, but Laneth's 'saboteur' and 'villain' both seem fairly juicy, while her smooth forehead fortuitously sneaks her into the Engineered collection.

With whispers around the community of an impending Klingon collection, this may be one 6-pack you can dip your toe into if you're a collection fiend and don't need to catch a legendary for your hunt to be considered a success. Qapla'!
