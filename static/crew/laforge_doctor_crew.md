One of only a few super rares with the elusive ENG/MED combo to keep him on those voyages past eight hours. The only La Forge with MED + a solid event count give him long-term value, even if he's bumped from that tricky voyage combo. Huge passive ship stats and double collections round him out nicely. Docked a point for a very expensive build, but he pays it off better than almost any other Super Rare.
