A "solid" Super Rare Burnham - stop me if you've heard this one before. Her all-too-common Skill set goes a long way towards letting her cash in on variant and Trait-related bonus Events.

In addition to incrementally more interesting Traits than your typical Burnham variant, the best element of this crew for newer players is a +9 Attack boost on Ships which comes online at six seconds and is an excellent medium-term Skirmish and Arena asset attached to a crew who you'd have to thaw regularly anyway.
