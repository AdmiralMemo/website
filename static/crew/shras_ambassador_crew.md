A former do it all crew, Shras has lost a good deal of his daily luster, but still offers a fine return on investment. Triple Collections headline this card for most players with something like Ambassador or Civilian threatening to make a Connect Four if WRG runs out of more interesting Collections to add in the meantime.

There’s also a nice Attack Boost to be had on Ships, even if it’s a hair slower than we might prefer. His Bases are still worthy of a thaw, but you will need his Traits to align to make it happen.
