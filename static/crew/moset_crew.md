Crell has been unfairly lumped into "not bridge crew" for a long time, but he just has those Traits that WRG seems to like and has produced the same as a mid-level main cast name off the back of them. His MED Primary and weak Bases may not have him on the first wave of Shuttles, but he hasn't hurt for opportunity.

Offering fine Collection value, Moset's floor of three, ceiling of five or six is bankable equity that should keep him floating above the bottom rungs of crew for a long time. And yet another angle of contribution especially relevant for new players; Gauntlet capability at one star with a reasonable number of elevated Crit Gauntlets and a couple of Skill pairs which aren't (yet) dominated by walls of overpowered Exclusive crew.

Moset will catch flak for his lack of power which you will certainly feel in many situations, but he offers too much utility to be written off for rosters of any level.
