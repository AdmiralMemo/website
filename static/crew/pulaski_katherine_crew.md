A fairly thin trait set and middling voyage rank may grab the eye, but MED crew play by different rules. Kathy remains a top ten MED voyager who has a plus voyage skill pair for all permutations of her set and a sizable base with admittedly limited chances at a weekend bonus. Medics don't come around too frequently and though it's a shame to see Pulaski's skill set tied to an event corpse, she's still strong enough to catch weekend work while pitching in worthwhile voyage credentials.
