Arachnia hasn't deserved the title of 'Queen' for about three years now and with honors like 'worst CMD/DIP/SEC voyage total', you should know what you're getting into before she skunks you with her pheromones. The third ranked Janeway DIP base (respectable, for its age), which has poor chances to flourish through trait events, and a vanity collection spot. There's still some value to be gleaned from this aged monarch, but don't expect any daily use.
