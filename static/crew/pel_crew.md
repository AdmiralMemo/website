Hmm. Yes. I find it fascinating that her family chose to drop the suffix Orton from her surname. It was my understanding that Pel Orton is a more noble appellation than simply Pel. Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend toward a more egalitarian society is partly responsible, eh? *Slaps back far too hard*

For an old two-skiller, there’s a bit more here than one might assume. Pel’s reasonable trait lineup offers her more event chances than past history might suggest and there is certainly no lack of DIP and CMD shuttle seats. Traits also power the only attribute which matters to most veterans perusing the Super Rare ranks: collections. Offering an early game, niche arena ability as well, Pel has avenues to contribute, but certainly doesn’t bring anything irreplaceable to the table.
