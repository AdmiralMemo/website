Normally we get a little frisky with notes for crew from iconic episodes, but this McCoy card has enough going on that we should dispense with the goofiness. Most obvious is the skill set which is a huge Voyage power refresh on the other Super Rares which share it. 

McCoy was an early Collection adopter, but even as the field has caught up to him, we’ll still take a handful of realized Collections vs a string of Traits in most cases. Another point of interest for long term value, Events, has McCoy coming up aces. His to-date tally is massive and he's already hit double digit variant features too. The number of McCoy MED options might keep Mirror in Cryostasis on some occasions, but the bonus opportunities will be there. 

McCoy also has a few decent Proficiencies for a Super Rare, so if you can snag a star for him early on in your game, he’s a reasonable stepping stone to better crew, given his more than two scores of elevated Crit chances.

An Attack Boost of nine or better from a Super Rare is a huge early game boon on Ships and even though it's a slow Initialization in this case, new players should do what they must to fully Fuse this Bones (if only for his other attributes) and let the 3x speed-up erase some of his start time deficit. Top to bottom, Mirror McCoy is a niche/power combo to chase and offers something for every level of roster.
