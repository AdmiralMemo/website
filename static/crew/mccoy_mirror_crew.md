Normally we get a little frisky with notes for crew from iconic episodes, but there's just not room this time - McCoy is a hit in too many areas. Most obvious is the skill set which is a huge voyage power refresh on the other super rares which share it. He's a slam dunk voyager into the mid-game.

Dual collections aren't terribly uncommon these days, but one (mirror) is still tough to complete and the other (physician) is due for expansion. Another point of interest for long term value, events, has McCoy coming up aces. His to-date tally is massive and he's already hit double digit variant features too. The number of McCoy MED options might keep Mirror in cryo on some occasions, but the bonus opportunities will be there.

An attack boost of nine or better from a super rare is a huge early game boon on ships and even though it's a slow initialization in this case, new players should do what they must to fully fuse this Bones and let the 3x speed-up erase some of his start time deficit. Top to bottom, Mirror McCoy is a niche/power combo to chase and offers something for every level of roster.
