I can't watch Narek and not think Eddie Redmayne, so I guess we'll title this one 'Fantastic Traits and Where to Find Them'. A half dozen viable Traits is plenty to work with and has granted Narek multi-Collection status already with nice growth potential in that area.

Some reasonable Base metrics may have him just outside of daily use with the likes of Anniversaru floating around, but should easily earn him Shuttle seating when one of his Traits catches a bonus.
