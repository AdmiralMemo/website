Hoshi fans rejoice! After five long and painful years, another Legendary version of the galaxy’s premiere linguist has arrived. Undisputed, this is also the best available version of Sato in the game, which isn’t saying much.

Debuting at a Voyage rank of 65 looks fantastic on paper, but sadly none of us have paper, only digital screens. The reality is that despite her six Anti-mater Trait matches, her Voyage power is locked behind a common skillset where there are over a dozen better options as of this writing, including some free giveaways like Pathfinder Uhura. Throw on the recent Portal update which brought several top Voyagers to the masses, and Hoshi is suddenly speaking her 87th language – sadness.

For players looking for immediate usage, she will be the first card in a Mega Event, so there is hope for a Faction bonus. She also boasts five Collections that buff various skills, with the ever-hopeful possibilities of more in the future.  Do you need an Accuracy bump in Arena or Fleet Boss Battles? If you said yes and you have literally zero other cards in this game, then Sato is your best bet!

At the end of the long road, the great artwork and temporary viability with Voyages will make all 19 remaining fans of Enterprise dance like it’s a party on Risa, but casually.
