Soval's Arena Evasion at one second is fairly unique, but needing a full contingent of stars just to protect a small credit investment doesn't by itself make Soval worth the Behold capital. 

As we work Collection value into the mix, it becomes possible to see a path to value on some rosters, but most of his attributes can be found tied to stronger crew who will justify their roster spot much more frequently than Soval.
