“Human females are so repulsive!” Uh...Yeah. The Golden Girls here aren't winning any beauty pagents for base or voyage work. but on ships, they're worth the admittedly cheap cost of fusion. Newer players will want (need) a strong attack crew to help them climb the arena ranks and progress through Skirmish difficulties to reap the lavish rewards of the event type. The duo may activate a bit slower than some of the more popular options, but can be built deterministically. Their collection spot should be a value add for many years to come and is worth the blu-sion for even established rosters.
