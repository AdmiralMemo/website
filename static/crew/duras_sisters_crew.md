“Human females are so repulsive!” Uh...Yeah. The Golden Girls here aren't winning any beauty pageants for their stats either.

Long respected for their Attack Boost with a relatively low cost to entry, there are simply too many competitive options, including those available through Crew Retrieval, to make a ten second initialization, behind a Trigger worth it. As an “upgrade” option for otherwise useless Rare Duras crew after you’ve finished their first copies, everyone should try to make this Fusion crew at your leisure for their Collection and Immortalization notches.
