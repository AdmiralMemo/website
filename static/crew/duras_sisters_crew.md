“Human females are so repulsive!” Not quite as repulsive as about 90% of the card. From skill set to traits to event chances to simple stat ranks, Lursa and B'Etor are repugnant. But on ships, they're worth the admittedly cheap cost of fusion. Newer players will want (need) a strong attack crew to help them climb the arena ranks and progress through Skirmish difficulties to reap the lavish rewards of the event type. The duo may activate a bit slower than some of the more popular options, but can be built deterministically by any level of roster.
