The only super rare variant of Guinan and, unfortunately, the least impressive of them all. If you earn her first copy from achievements, it’s perhaps best to leave her unclaimed for a little while until you net another star from voyages or have campaign citations to burn. Saddled with bad bases and vaguely uneventable traits, this imp will contribute little in the long run outside of 65% gauntlet crit in everybody’s favorite ‘Guinan Gauntlet’ - and even then, usually amongst walls of her much bigger sisters. She’s a Ron Popeil special - just freeze and forget if you luck out or pay the price to fuse.
