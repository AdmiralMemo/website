Any discussion of Dahj that doesn't involve her footwear choices or Kid Vid glasses has to start with her voyage prowess, where an eye-popping total meets the perennially scarce SEC/SCI pair. In a combo where the likes of Klingon Janeway and EV Suit Seven are still voyage-relevant, Dahj provides a direct upgrade few other cards can match.

In the brave new world of WRG event planning, where no show or cast bonuses can be counted on, our crystal ball is cloudier than ever. The precedent of Lore/B4 not counting for Data events dictates that variant bonuses for Dahj are unlikely, but chances are Androids will be a going concern for the future, and she is now the #1 SEC base among Androids by a sizeable margin (it was a good run, Detective Data), even throwing in a top 5 SCI base for good measure.

Even without a particularly useful ship ability, any Gauntlet use, or even an unlimited Data plan, Dahj is well worth activating. Just steer clear of the Romulans.
