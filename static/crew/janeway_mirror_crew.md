Her Bases leave quite a bit to be desired, but this was a crew made for the Collection era with qualities ranging from a gorgeous Trait set to Faction queen Janeway's weekend reputation and plus Skill set for Shuttles. The main course is her huge immediate and potential Collection value, so she's a name that most players cannot afford to overlook.
