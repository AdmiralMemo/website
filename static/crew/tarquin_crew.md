Ms. Cleo is heating up in the Collections department, which is good for him, because there's not much room for him to maneuver elsewhere. Managing to parlay four Traits into four Collections, he doesn’t have much juice left, which is fine, cause Hoshi’s creepy telepathic stalker may be better left forgotten in Cryostasis until his DIP base calls him to work on a weekend Faction Shuttle.
