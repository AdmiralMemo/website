You might think, “Oh great, it’s Enterprise Pike!” when you see this crew in a Behold, but unfortunately this is a Discovery-era Pike that is in early 2019 inclusion in the game and shows that age. Withered Voyage score and the most mid of Skill Sets make this Chris solely a value in Pike or variant Events or if his remaining bland Traits hit a Collection. He’ll top out at four Collections if he gets lucky.
