Old, two Skills…there are reasons aplenty to eschew Doc, but this crew does have “good bones”, and would probably be a pretty interesting option with a Power Crept coat of paint.

As it stands, most of his abilities will leave you whelmed. Hefty, Triggerless Instant Damage comes online slower than you’d like and his nine spot of 45% Gauntlet sets would sure look better alongside stronger Proficiencies, or at least in a Skill pair not buried behind walls of Armus and Surak.

His Collection value is late to the party as well, even though there’s quite a bit of room to grow there. Despite his old school power levels, Proton's archnemesis has enough niche benefits to occasionally flash usefulness for younger rosters.
