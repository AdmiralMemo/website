It's happened without fanfare, but the medical drought of yesteryear has lifted. Sprinkled throughout events, recurring megas, and even giveaways, 2020 has provided an average of one legendary MED voyager per month - all of them better than Nona.

The impulse to reach for a crew offering MED and CMD in one package is understandable, but Nona's debut voyage power is depressing, despite being her one and only highlight.

Wholly uneventable traits and a primary skill which struggles to find shuttle seating have reduced her to effective in a single area. With deference to the game's track record with skill combos and an ever-present MED/CMD deficiency, Nona is not a bottom barrel crew on release, but will certainly age like one.
