This crew is probably on Nona your Voyage, Nona your Gauntlets, and Nona your Ships. 

Without the Voyage power or Proficiencies to put her plus Skill set to good use, she’s exactly the amount of value provided by her Trait list, which is above average but mostly untapped at this point. If over time her Traits provide weekend work and her Collection ceiling of five is reached, then she’ll be a merely adequate crew.
