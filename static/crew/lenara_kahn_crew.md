Kahn (no relation) is in trouble. She's got Trait envy and only WRG's dartboard can save her now. The first non-Dax Trill heralded an expansion of that subset of characters (Odan, oh boy!), but without a Collection or Event attached to that growth, it may have only angered the Jadzia faithful.

Our advice: ignore this crew until she has at least two Collections and then try to find a Legendary Behold in which she has more than the other options.
