There are two types of rosters mulling Lissan in Legendary Beholds; those just starting out in the game and taking her so-so Gauntlet ability to help them out of a bad Behold or late-game players eyeing her Traits to get them out of a bad Behold. In either case, you shouldn’t be considering her if there are any respectable options flanking her.

Two near identical Proficiencies give her a nice on-paper CMD/DIP roll, but there are a few flies in her soup. Gauntlet Exclusive Balok will form a Demilitarized Zone of walls for years to come and Lissan lacks a beefy single roll to pick up any lucky 1-for-2 rolls against weaker competition. If her specific Skill pair doesn’t pop up, you’re out of luck.

At least most of her Collection value comes front-loaded. We could see that count creep upwards, but only if WRG runs out of more Viable Traits or wants to play a joke on us.
