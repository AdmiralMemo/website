The second part of everyone’s favorite Romulan duo has arrived and we can’t help but wonder…which Fusion is he going to be a part of? Argumentative Laris and Zhaban? From The North Zhaban and Laris? Zhaban and Jalad At Tanagra? Okay I might have gotten carried away there, what was I talking about…oh yes…COLLECTIONS.

Sporting a solid quartet of Collections, he has what you want in a Super Rare. Zhaban’s DIP and DIP/SEC scores are fairly worthwhile for Shuttle work, absolutely a contender for unfreezing from Cryostasis should his Trait set match, or we get the oft-rumored “Zhaban But Now With A Gun Too” in a Faction Event. But that’s about the end of it, he desperately misses some form of MED given his time giving literal care to Picard but we won’t obsess too much and relegate him to join the cavalcade of Super Rare two Skillers in the frozen north of Cryostasis.
