Like many two year old crew at this point in the game without a unique value proposition, Tribble Kirk is down to his Trait set as one of his few remaining attributes. Sadly for this chicken sandwich enjoyer, Kirk has only five Traits, and only one of them hits a Collection (granted one you need just about every crew for to complete it).  

Tribble Kirk’s Arena ability, a 325% Instant Damage without a Trigger and with a use limit of twice, has been overshadowed by many cards, so perhaps if he appears in a Behold very early on in your playing career, you may want to take him until you can arrange to Retrieve a better option for Arena and Skirmishes.  At least Kirk events appear to be somewhat evergreen, even though he’s enjoyed only two during each of the last two calendar years. Still, you could do worse to invest in a Kirk.
