The lede - this Neelix variant can be fused with Security Chief Tuvok to make Tuvix; a Super Rare crew who, if nothing else, has Collection value that's easier to obtain than finishing a Legendary crew. 

Neelix variants are some of the biggest winners of WRG's shift toward making Timelines a card collecting game. His big swath of previously useless Traits are now becoming the backbone of boosting up the power of your Super Rare and Legendary crew into the endgame. That also applies to the fusion result, Tuvix. This particular Neelix has provided decent value for those brave enough to immortalize him; three non-Rarity Collections, with two more Traits still to be implemented into Collections.

Sunday Cadet Missions are a possibility thanks to Neelix's uncommon Skill pairing which could help on out Missions Three and Five. Beyond that, he's merely Collection fodder who should probably be somewhere in the middle of your immortalization list for Rare crew, perhaps even after finishing Tuvix.
