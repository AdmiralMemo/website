Blue Odo always seems to pop up in my personal playthroughs thanks to that Constable/Interrogator SEC node which gatekeeps the only access to sonic drivers. But while heâ€™s useful there and does qualify for Sunday cadet work, most of his long term value is theoretical in the form of untapped collection traits. Considering his equip cost includes seventy seven Bajoran phasers and handfuls of other faction items, you may want to leave him as a leveling project in the midgame instead of rushing to finish him early.
