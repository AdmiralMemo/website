The former Undisputed Champion of Timelines took a lot of body blows in 2019. Her early game arena damage was replaced by better, faster, stronger from all angles (Event, Packs, Mega) and CMD/SCI went from underrated to overrepresented. Late-year mega crew Timelord Tenavik does a fair impersonation of her on shuttles and voyages to boot.

But we're far from the panic button and what she offers, though less difficult to find these days, is still unquestionably elite. Her base and voyage power as well as a sterling event clip still demand you smash that Select button on the behold screen. If you cite your weakest areas, Burnham may not top that particular list, but she tops enough different lists to earn your honor and behold capital before too long.
