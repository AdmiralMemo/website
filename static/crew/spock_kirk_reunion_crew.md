As Ooby Dooby Riker would say, "Oh, they're blended alright." In this case, the perfect blend of uniqueness and power. This fusion crew plays host to a monster event portfolio headlined by a reliability that you won't see from crew who depend more on traits to provide you with regular weekend support.

Jim Kirk has a runaway lead for both Faction and total events, while Spock brings his own brand name and Vulcan trait to the table. In concert with their huge SCI base and a CMD secondary to supplement two characters strangely lacking in CMD options, RSK (or Spork, if you prefer) is a shoo-in for permanent Faction work.

The other area they impress in is voyages. Their #1 debut score is the first time in twenty-six months that the game has seen a new top voyager. While the skill set is frankly overrepresented, RSK attempts to sidestep a low value over replacement with raw power. The score gap between them and CMD/DIP/SCI #2 is the same as that between #2 and #10 - they're in a league of their own.

If you're looking for even more value from your investments, a few peripherals of note - double collections, including the 40 threshold Vulcan, and a handful of 45% gauntlets to go with proficiencies which are new player only. But don't you want to brighten your gauntlet opponent's day with Kirk's smiling face?
