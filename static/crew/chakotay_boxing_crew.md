Such a bizarre card from an episode I had completely forgotten about. Hang on, let me get my announcer voice on. 
“In The Left Corner With The #1 SEC Stat For 3* Crews, It’s Acoocha Moyer Himself! Chaaaaaaaakotay!”
In all seriousness his SEC stat is one of the highest a new player will get and his combination of skills, although quite common, makes him a great voyager. But with no extra collection bonuses and no use on weekend cadet challenges, don’t feel too bad if you have to push him out of the ring.
