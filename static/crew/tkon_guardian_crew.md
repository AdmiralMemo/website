Don't get suckered in by Portal's third Skill or token amount of ENG; this is a crew with three Traits, almost no Event chances, and zero daily usefulness. He sits firmly entrenched among the worst Legendary crew in the game and doesn't deserve a second glance until both Duelist and Telepath are Collections.

P.S. Bring back the energy whips.
