Thisa Narissa is the trouble with quibbles. Her art ain't right. She should be a SEC primary. Why is she a super rare?

Now, if Narissa had given us something else to be excited about, such nitpicks would be squelched. Instead, we're left with a bland might-as-well-be 2-skiller with thin event potential, barring a Picard-a-thon streak of megas to rival the Disco inferno.

Scoop up the Romulan collection notch, if you still need it, courtesy of the Galaxy hybrid she comes from and cross your fingers for her traits to trigger before too long.
