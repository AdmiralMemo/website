Event chances shouldn't be taken for granted in the era of the Trait Mega Events and Silik's CMD Base would be fine to thaw for Event Shuttles. But with zero usefulness in other areas of the game, his Traits have finally paid off with a duo of Collections, and may find one more before the game explodes in a rain of server errors.
