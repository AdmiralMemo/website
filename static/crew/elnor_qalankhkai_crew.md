Quackquack Elnor was the third Legendary crew introduced via the Ubercampaign Track, and he nearly derailed the whole darn thing. A tired skill Set doesn’t allow his still-strong Voyage power to contribute much anymore, but at least he can fill that Romulan Anti-matter seat, right?

The good news for players who paid for him and either finished him via a 5th star or have him hanging around partially-Fused is that eventually he’ll catch an entire handful of Collections, but until then you’ll have to wait for the value that the occasional Trait or infrequent variant Event might give.
