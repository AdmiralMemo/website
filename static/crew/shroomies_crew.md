Left Shroomie is a monster Voyage and Ship anchor boasting arguably the top spot in both areas. With an upper echelon Voyage score and eight (!!!) Antimatter traits in a Skill order bereft of choices (Harry loses again), Shroomies will command seats alongside partially-Fused Legendary crew and beat out any CMD/DIP/WHATEVER Event Super Rares that get thrown your way.

He also combines a hefty +9 peanut butter Attack Boost with the velvety chocolate of everybody’s favorite Instant Damage to make him a cornerstone Ship Battles piece if you’d rather spend your early game Crew Retrievals somewhere other than five laborious stars on an otherwise ineffectual Captain Killy.

Right Shroomie holds up his end of the bargain too, going to the well of Traits as often as he possibly can. That downright erotic Trait list doesn’t just supercharge their Voyages, but also gives them a head-spinning number of elevated Gauntlet Crit sets including ten(!!!) 45% sets, most of which see them with multiple top five Skill pairs thanks to competitive Proficiencies. Gauntlet Exclusive TKK will be the wall crew du jour, but Shroomie’s clutch SCI Primary is enough to allow him to steal table scraps and scoop up wins when the Legendaries aren’t looking.

Yeah, Shroomies deserves a fourth paragraph - this one detailing a sumptuous Collection portfolio. Already owning spots in a few arduous Collections, their #TRAITS strike again, promising a mammoth value ceiling. While WRG is on record saying they’d like to lean into smaller Collections, none of those on the list here come close to the disqualifyingly large pools of Desperate or Civilian. If only a few more Collection trophies adorn the Shroomies' shelf, they will be the cherries on top of this do-it-all, stunningly great Super Rare who leads the conversation for best in the game.
