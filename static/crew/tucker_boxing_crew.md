Fake Tucker was born with some disappointing numbers that have only gotten lower. He's not quite usable day to day (or shouldn't be), but can make a case for himself as an Event/Collection combo. 

Tucker has managed to squeeze at least one variant Event in each calendar year out of a company that didn’t seem to think much of his TV show, but with the advent of the Enterprise Collection and more of his eclectic Traits hitting, he’s a viable Behold choice and maybe even someone you might want to spend some Quantum on. Four Collections and a Vanity are his ceiling (which he’s achieved), but it’s a good ceiling.
