While All Good Things may have been unduly harsh about how certain cast members would age (we can all agree Admiral Riker vs. actual Jonathan Frakes circa 2022 is a Jameson-level disservice to the actor, aye?), it wasn't too far off the mark with LeVar Burton, barring the distinctly late 80s/early 90s perm he has going on, of course. On the mark just about sums up the card, too; a good SR voyager, for those still using them; a distinctly useable ENG base for the odd Geordi Faction - yes, they're rare, but they do happen; and some nice, non-standard traits, including two tricky collections and the potential for some more. That being said, he'll quickly be freezer fuel without wider utility, and we have to dock points for the baffling lack of the Federation trait, as well as the fact that his Arena quote isn't telling Irumodic Picard that there's a problem with the warp core, or the phase inducers, or some other damn thing.
