There's a theory out there that suggests Grudge, the cat, is the one controlling Booker and this card might lend credence to that. Think about it - big Command presence, rarely voyages, senses others' suffering (Empath). I'm just saying...we should look into it.

Book 'n Grudge is a fantastic card to kick off the Mirror mega...the 2017 Mirror mega. His voyage power is closer to most of the Mirror crew to come out of that aged mega event than it is to rockstar Mirror Jean-Luc Picard. A plus skill set and serviceable numbers should catch Book some work over the next year, but investing in him with the expectation of a big voyage boost is sort of like marrying the Prom King in his 60s.

The main course is Grudge's big CMD base, but it begs the question - for what shuttles? B&G debut in a non-Bonus Disco mega and with over a year since the last true Discovery bonus and a bloated pool of crew beside, you'll be hanging your hat on the occasional trait event or future Grudge variants who don't drop in a 6-pack. With three CMD primary mega crew over the last year, the five-star trek to get some more help on daily shuttles isn't quite as worthwhile as the stat ranks would lead you to believe.

There's zero peripheral benefit here and so while B&G's numbers are still fine for general use at the time of his debut, he's as useful now as you'd hope the crew you cited 2-3 years ago would be.
