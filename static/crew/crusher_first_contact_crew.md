Crusher is simply not an event player so a usable-when-bonus MED base may languish without a use for long periods. Her uncommon MED/CMD stack belies a gross voyage score and in combination with theoretical event potential makes her a strong avoid, unless you're banking on an expansion of her bloated Physician collection.
