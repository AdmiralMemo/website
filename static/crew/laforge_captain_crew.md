So, it was cool to see Geordi on Star Trek: Voyager.

This card is really bad though. Voyages and Bases indicative of his 2016 launch date, no utility on Ships or in the Gauntlet, and only two viable Traits for Collections or bonus Events. At least Geordi is a decent Event name on his own, so you might find yourself using his CMD Base on some requisition Shuttles.
