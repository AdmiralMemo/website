Okay, so you have a couple of options with Mr. Vulcan here. You can level him up and immortalise to use his SEC base for Sunday Cadet missions, as well as fill out a somewhat easy slot in the Vulcan collection. Or, keep him at level 99 and fuse with him Ambassador Neelix to make the meh-inducing novelty crew that is Tuvix. Early game players should take note of his mighty +10000 Crit for Ship Battles, itâ€™s only logical.
