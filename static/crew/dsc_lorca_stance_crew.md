An old card by Discovery standards, Lorca has been a true shuttle anchor with a massive event tally since his debut, but his crystal ball is looking awfully cloudy going forward. With his character seemingly phased out of the show (hey, we're past the spoiler period) and the Discovery bonus pool ballooning, he might find work very much harder to come by in the future. Working in his favor is the #1 Mirror and Explorer CMD base, though he's looking like less of a boss and more of an Assistant to the District Manager going forward.
