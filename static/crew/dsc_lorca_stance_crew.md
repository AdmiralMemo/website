This space used to detail Lorca’s top CMD/DIP Shuttle pair, which now sits somewhere in the 40s or 50s or 100s I don’t know, I’m just the writer. Most players are only going to utilize this cleaned up Isaacs variant when he has an Event bonus, which is predictably far less often than when Discovery Mega Events ruled the game.

Still, with a few viable Traits for Events and Collections in hand, Lorca isn’t really *that* far out of contention when stacked up next to the hundreds of other crew in similar situations. Just keep in mind that long stretches of irrelevance should be expected.
