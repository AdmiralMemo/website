Like my belt at Thanksgiving, we're going to see just how much Paris' skill set can handle before it snaps. It's already Altas holding up the world as the best skill set in the game drags pathetic voyage strength kicking and screaming into service for some of the game's rarest skill combos and even puts some medium strength gauntlet roles into play, thanks to that lack of competition and the occasional 45% gauntlets.

CMD and ENG bases still tops for Paris variants may be equally weak, but Paris boasts a good Faction rate thus far and only one of nine traits have been picked for mega duty, leaving him more wiggle room there. A skill set does not a crew make and even though it's done a valiant job making Paris relevant thus far, when you start adding stars to him you're going to wonder how many it takes before the numbers on the screen finally look good.
