Sitting vaguely in the teens’ ranks for ENG/SEC Voyagers with some vaguely Event-viable Traits, this character you vaguely remember from a vaguely remembered series has shuffled off the cruel yoke of daily duty to instead be that Legendary you’re thinking about finishing for the Blue Man Collection since you have four copies of her from her Campaign. Or something.

A one time useful Voyager simply didn’t have the debut power to endure and has become a series of rounded edges whose best look is a long term one, as Talas waits on additional value via Collections. As for Legendary Beholds, antennae fetishists get the green light to invest, but the rest of us should look elsewhere for better long term or unique potential.
