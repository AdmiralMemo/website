DB provided too many ENG/SEC choices throughout 2019 to make Talas worth the foray into 6-pack territory, but if you somehow missed a year's worth of offerings and need voyage help for that combo, Talas qualifies.

Sitting vaguely in the top ten ENG/SEC voyagers with some vaguely eventable traits, this character you vaguely remember from a vaguely remembered series has the raw stats to provide help to almost any roster in today's landscape, even if she's not your typical top-shelf, wise investment. Antennae fetishists get the green light to invest, but the rest of us should look for better long term or unique potential.
