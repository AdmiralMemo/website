Keevan is almost an exact copy of Jazz Musician Riker but with a few tradeoffs. Keevan has a slightly higher CMD base but his Proficiency is much lower. His Ship ability grants more Evasion at the cost of Attack but he has some use on the Sunday Cadet Missions whereas Riker doesn’t. I think the state of your game will decide which to keep and which to move on. If you need those Dadets completed then Keevan is the better choice but if you are struggling to do damage in ship battles then Riker is the answer. Or just chuck them both and find Klingon Dukat...oh he will also need a lot of Dominion items…

If can find it in your heart to complete poor Keevan, you’ll see him begin to pay dividends in your cryostatis vault as time goes on, as he accumulates more Collections that hit his Traits.
