While Acting Captain Riker would like nothing more than to kick some treacherous Tal Shiar ass, there isn’t a lot of ass kicking he’s going to be doing on a daily basis anymore. Silver Fox Riker here is a Collection/Event combination crew like so many other showing their age; look for him to pick up at most a trio of Collections (about average for a Legendary crew) and his common Skill set will allow him to sit in many a Faction Event Shuttle when Riker variant or Trait bonus Events occur.
