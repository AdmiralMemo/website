Even with good reason to be punitive toward the most common skill order in the game, Not-Captain Captain Riker brings enough power and just enough versatility to make him a recommended grab.

Sitting above the formerly formidable Kahless on voyages, Riker won't have as much leeway as he ages due to the abundance of CMD/SEC, but he at least debuts in good shape and should be a fine voyage cog through year one.

Despite a base rank sandwiched between Navaar and Helmsman Wyatt (what the fuck?), the Riker name has been an event mainstay, snagging multiple features in each calendar year. A common skill set works much better for shuttles than voyages, giving him ample opportunity to pitch in there.

Aside from a few eventable traits, Cap'n rounds out his contributions to your roster with a substantial amount of arena accuracy, in case you'd like to place Riker where he belongs - on your Bridge, kicking some treacherous Romulan ass.
