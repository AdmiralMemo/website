A handful of yellowy-green attributes on Telek’s scorecard are probably less telling than one might assume. A single star on a Super Rare crew will offer more punch on voyages and shuttles, while R’mor’s hidden traits only afford him cadet eligibility one day per week. This is a card best left as collection fodder to give you something to work on as you’re leaving the early game and already have your roster set up for success.
