Still a useful crew to own for Tuesday’s cadet missions, this time-hopper has seen a bit of his shine wear off as other Uncommons (including some must-have Female Aliens) have exceeded his once notable SCI Base. While he still possess the lowest SEC base of any 2*, the early game Voyage use can’t be discounted and he will tide you over in your quest for Super Rares.
