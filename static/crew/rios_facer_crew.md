Just ludicrously lush art, which is likely what you wanted him for anyways. Several gold chains, rakish red hat, the hide of some sort of green animal draped over his smoking jacket. Rios is telling you, “I missed him by *that* much.”

That’s about where his value ends; a three Collection ceiling, which as of now is still at its floor of zero, gives him little long-term use outside of Behold Insurance™.
