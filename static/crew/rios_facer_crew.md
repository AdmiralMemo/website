If Rios had debuted a year ago, this note would have told you that he was a name to bet on - DIP/ENG was a little harder to come by, and at the time, we had no idea that the much ballyhooed new Star Trek show starring Sir Patrick Stewart was going to net crew a whopping zero associated show events.

As it stands, all the crew you'd want from that first season have either been sprinkled into trait megas or six packs like these, and this just isn't a card that feels worth diving for, unless you're chasing a brand new avatar with a hat that could rival Age of Sail Worf. 

Zero collections, a Gauntlet pair ranked just high enough to register but low enough that new Gauntlet reward Red Angel will smash him into paste, one viable mega trait (Undercover Operative, where his DIP base is a solid #2), and the wrong primary make this broody, existentialist spaceman a hard sell at the best of times.

That being said, if you've somehow missed one of the better DIP/ENG options that have come our way last year, then main cast on a currently airing Star Trek show still counts for something, he WOULD be the #2 Picard show DIP if it ever happens, and his numbers are on the right side of daily use, especially in an uncommon, if not rare, voyage stack.
