It’s been quite the fall from grace for AT Saru who didn’t debut with beaucoup power, but had a nice Skill set niche and the Discovery Mega Event freight train powering his weekend work.

Now a daily option no longer, Saru needs those Event bonuses to keep rolling in for him to have a chance to justify your investment. He has indeed done well in the few years following the “Age of Discovery Mega Events” thanks to a helping hand from the Exobiology Trait, but on balance he sits on the low end of your typical aged Event/Collection combo pieces. It’s alright to add stars if you have Saru already, but don’t go out of your way to acquire him.
