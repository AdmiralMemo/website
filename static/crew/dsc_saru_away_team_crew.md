Double 1k bases for what we have to assume are plenty of future events and above average voyage numbers for an option-deficient skill set. You can count on one hand the number of SEC/SCI voyagers rated higher and when there's that kind of exclusivity, the totals matter less. He's lost a bit of shine as each Disco mega adds new SEC or SCI bases to the list, but the fact that this note even includes the phrase "each Disco mega" is another reason to get him on your roster.
