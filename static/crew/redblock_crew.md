This Pok√©mon was an elite Voyager for a long time, but even though certain surface level metrics are still serviceable, his Skill set is not and he shouldn't be chased one Humpty Dumpty star at a time through Beholds for that purpose. A new player may find some use as a one-star proposition thanks to plenty of Crit power and a big CMD roll in the Gauntlet.

Many players have their eye on his Collections. Already offering a few as of this writing, his ceiling in this area is higher than most and once that list is fleshed out a little more, he'll be able to pay off his extremely expensive build of 100+ Faction Items and several Super Rare Components.
