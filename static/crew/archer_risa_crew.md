The pessimist might say, "He's a direct downgrade from Humbled Archer - base, voyage, and skill set!" The optimist might say, "He's a direct downgrade from Humbled Archer - base, voyage, and skill set. I don't have to waste dil on him!"

Although crew deserve to be ranked on their own merits and not always against their big brothers, to quote a player reaction from Arthos' release, "This card does not need to be." If you happen to have Humbled Archer, you have Arthos and more.

About those previously mentioned merits, the requisite power creep numbers are certainly there; a fat DIP base and sturdy voyage score, but almost nothing else is. A thin trait set which may as well number three (If we're all in Starfleet, are any of us really in Starfleet?) does support a single collection, but is not brimming with event potential.

Which especially hurts for a character like Archer. "Main cast" and "Captain" has netted him about an event per year. His variant event count sits tied with the likes of Lord Neelix, The Most High Chakotay, and Sir Wesley the Brave.

A vanilla crew in the truest sense of the phrase, Archer's surface level numbers are a boon and, if fused, will guarantee him day one work on almost any roster if you want to venture into his debut pack which includes headliner Gary Seven. But his cliff is a lot sharper and coming a lot sooner than the level of crew you'd want to dive into a weekday 6-pack for.
