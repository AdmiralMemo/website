One half of the long-awaited 'DBZ in space' fusion crew has arrived in the game. 

A surprisingly relevant Event option for a card with 'Gauntlet crew' Bases, Kira is the picture of consistency when it comes to Event bonuses. Kira does boast worthwhile overall power and a good single roll - good enough to be an option in most of her 25% Gauntlets. Unfortunately, her Crit is capped at that amount and her Skill set is ultra competitive. If you pick her up while you're still Balok-less or to avoid Kahless' price tag, she'll put in more work for you than she would on a "complete" roster, but she's at least an occasional option for everyone.
