Same boring old Wesley, now featuring Wunderkind! He's been upgraded from entirely useless to merely mostly useless thanks to his inclusion in the Prodigy Collection, and that only needs 20 Immortalizations to max out its Stat Boosts. Don't let his SCI/ENG fool you, Last Minute Cosplay Idea Wesley still offers next to nothing to even the newest of players, so freeze him as soon as you get Acting Ensign Crusher (if not sooner).
