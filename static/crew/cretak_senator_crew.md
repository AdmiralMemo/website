One of the top Romulan Senators in the game, Cretak is otherwise a wet noodle. Minor usefulness in the form of Cadet Missions (praise be to Female Aliens!) and a place in two Stat-Boosting Collections (plus the all-important Rare Collection that gives great boosts to early game players) is her only saving grace.
