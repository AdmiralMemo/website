Colonel Wai Lin's Voyage score remains stout even years after her debut, but a retread Skill set and severe lack of Antimatter Traits will see her crowded out of that area before too long. Luckily, she's everyone's favorite Empress (sorry Hoshi), bringing a Triggerless 200% Instant Damage Ship Ability and juicy Shuttle metrics to the table.

An up and down Event history includes a bonus tally inflated by a rash of Discovery Mega Events, but Yeoh seems firmly entrenched in Trek at this point and her Traits have provided as many Event bonuses as we could ask for from a pool that size. With early game usage and a perpetually viable SEC Base, Georgiou is a card worth taking home to meet your mother...just make sure you're cooking ganglia that night.
