Sporting a dizzying #1 voyage SEC, Colonel Wai Lin's overall voyage total remains among the elite a year and a half after her debut, while boasting an event count that ticks all the right boxes, including Section 31, Mirror Universe, Discovery â€¦ she's everyone's favourite Empress (sorry Hoshi), even bringing a potent 200% instant damage ship ability to the table. 

Her sole black mark is the skill set, but if you could only pick one CMD/DIP/SEC super rare, Georgiou is probably the one. This big base SEC is a card worth taking home to meet your mother. Just make sure you're cooking ganglia that night.
