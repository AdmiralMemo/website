Locked, cocked, and loaded since the Big Book was a twinkle in my eye, we can finally proclaim; Headin' out to Eden, Yeah Brother! This Pike hits the triumvirate of base, voyage, and event power while graciously sporting a splash of SCI to avoid the dreaded redundant skill set of redundancy. If you're after a crew comp, look no further than the former campaign offering Professor Sato. They share a skill order so Pike is a voyage upgrade in almost every category while also septupling her event count at the cost of owning a merely mortal DIP base.

If you're a free-to-player who's hurting for big DIP due to a lack of strong mega DIP crew, Pike is someone to grab a copy of and even star up, especially if the Discovery megas keep rolling.
