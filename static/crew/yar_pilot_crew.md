Yar's great Faction event rate plus some juicy traits keep her afloat on the weekends, but it's not 2016 anymore and 'dual 1k bases' doesn't cut it - she won't be piloting shuttles without a bonus. But the bigger shift in her value was the dump truck of ENG/SEC crew that was backed up to our rosters in 2019, sending her tumbling down the ranks of a formerly difficult voyage skill combo.

There's still a 1-star node unlock (Pilot/SEC) and 45% gauntlet opportunities to help out newer players as well as a fairly exclusive collection spot for veteran players. Yar remains well-rounded, but without power to offer in any single area.
