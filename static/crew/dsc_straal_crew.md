Zoom Call Straal (trust me, you don't want to see him face to..."face") profiles pretty similarly to fellow innovator Emory Erickson, whom you might be familiar with from his campaign. Two Collections, one more viable Trait,, quickly eroding Voyage power and little else. It's fine to beam aboard some crew like that if situations are favorable; Campaign, maybe some lucky packs, but you'll want a bit more meat on the bones of most of your investments at the Legendary level. 

With the presumptive end of Discovery Megas Events, those two aforementioned Traits (Innovator, Explorer) are going to need to do a lot of heavy lifting for events, because...uh...there won't be variants. With little else of note on the periphery of this card, it's best to only approach Straal if you can get him fused in his salad years while his Voyaging fungi are still producing.
