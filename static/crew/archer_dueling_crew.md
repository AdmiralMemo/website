Ushaan Archer is a launch card - and all that goes along with that. Needless to say his Stats are a relic, but does he have anything else in the tank?

Ushaan's probably most useful to the brand new account. With his first star he offers a handful of Node unlocks, most notably the Pilot/SEC Node in the Celestial Temple, and some introductory Gauntlet work. His SEC roll just barely still qualifies to be called 'formidable' while his dozen elevated Crit Gauntlets (one 45%) and ability to 2-for-1 a lone SEC or ENG roll will make many Gauntlets in your first few months in the game.

Veteran players are looking at a Trait-supplemented, reasonable Event clip and a trio of Traits which could all become Collections out of nowhere. Ushaan clearly lacks for power, but not necessarily utility and makes a hell of a bridge crew photo op next to Ushaan Shran.
