The Golden Goose for all areas of the game, Commando Crusher has aged like fine wine since launch. Still sitting comfortably in the #1 MED Base position, sheâ€™ll destroy most Nodes she qualifies for (which, thanks to her diverse list of Traits, is a fair amount). A Triggerless 200% Instant Damage in Ship Battles makes her a must have for newer players in both Arena and Skirmish Events, and even the elderly crowd will want to have her on hand for Fleet Boss Battles.
