If you’ve arrived at this crew page looking for a variant of Jack Ransom or Rudolph Ransom, you took a wrong turn. If you’ve arrived at this page looking for a thinly-Traited Andorian played by Jeff Combs, you’re in the right place! 

The good news is that this Shran from the episode of Star Trek: Enterprise that doesn’t exist (it ended with “Terra Prime”, dammit!) has parlayed those four Traits (and one hidden one) into a trio of Collections with room for perhaps two more tucked into that fur coat. Along with those Collections, Shran has Events in scads, including two Featured events, one of which that has been Rerun, and big enough Bases for a Super Rare to pitch in.
