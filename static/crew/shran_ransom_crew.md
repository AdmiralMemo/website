I can see you over there, running a fine-toothed Comb through Ransom Shran's stats in the vague hope of finding long lasting worth. I could quote the esteemed Lieutenant Commander Tuvok and exclaim, we ain't found shit! But that wouldn't be quite true, not to mention vulgar, so let's parse out what little is here.

Shran, and to a slightly more fun extent, Combs variants do get event play, so a DIP base of this strength will see use eventually, even if you might be scratching your head and wondering why we're still getting Caregivers now and not, say, during the Caregiver mega. Beyond that, extremely early game players will find him a merely OK voyager until he's replaced by the inevitable mega crew CMD/DIP/SEC refresh, and . . . well, now we come back to the fine toothed Comb.

For those of you looking to create a 'people with boxes' bridge crew, or who may be waiting for Rios variants to have a line of Trek pimps, you'll get some laughs out of his art, but the rest of us are decidedly po-faced. Come on, Wicked Realms - isn't it time for a decent Shran? I implore you, reconsider your thoughts and actions . . . before the Andorian Mining Consortium reconsiders them for you.
