Macroviruses tremble when Rifle Janeway walks down the corridors of The Voyager with her compression rifle! Janeway’s primary value is clearing CMD Nodes on Cadet Challenges during the “female only” Missions, and once you’ve moved past needing to run those manually, enjoy her two non-Rarity Collections and park her in Cryostasis.
