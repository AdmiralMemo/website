His #2 overall CMD proficiency roll, rivaled only by Kahless, gives him ranked pair power even against legendary crew and he frequently catches increased crit values. It also helps make him a usable, if fairly dated voyage option. Though that doesn't leave much meat on the bone for bases, he's had a half dozen events thus far and owns spots in two stat-boosting collections.
