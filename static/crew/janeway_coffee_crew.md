While this particular variant is as boring as dollar store vanilla ice cream, she’s still a warm and able body for the Faction queen as owner of the top Super Rare Janeway CMD. A narrow window as a quick Accuracy boost crew on Ships would seemingly be her only other use - but wait! There’s more!

Just like Tuvix and the Duras Sisters, this particular Janeway can be Fused with Mutated Paris to form Evolved Janeway, an Event piece nesting doll with a place in every Voyager fan’s heart. The resultant Legendary crew may not be as statistically appealing as she once was, but is still a far stronger option overall than a few dated Super Rares. Our advice; make the lizard first and swing back around to scoop up a few more Super Rare Immortalizations down the line.
