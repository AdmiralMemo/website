The ENG/CMD pair may still be plus value at the legendary level, but Geordi's voyage power is too poor to function as much more than stepping stone in that area. And though he faces no super rare competition for ENG shuttles in La Forge events, his Faction rate sits around a paltry 30% and his base behind six legendary variants (though not all are worth fusing). Still, long term value in the form of a strong event clip and two collections makes him worth the behold capital, even if you don't use him right away.
