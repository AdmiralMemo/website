Detroit T’Pol retains much of her charm after aging a little for daily use since her debut, something we can’t say about the Motor City. Still Voyage-viable for early fame players, and with a strong SEC Base for Shuttles, can you tell her how to get, how to get to Carpenter Street?

T’Pol’s heady Trait list gives her one of the better Collection and Event profiles in the game. Pre-loaded with a serious tally in both areas, there’s no reason to believe those numbers will suddenly halt their inevitable tick upwards and help put her in rarefied air as far as long term value options go. If T’Pol is on the Tongo board; Acquire, Acquire, Acquire!
