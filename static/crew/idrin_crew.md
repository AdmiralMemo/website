Meh, one of the few Hirogen in the game who as a species specializes in roaming and hunting does neither very well. Be prepared to run faction missions or open up the replicator to equip him too, but feel free to thank us later when his Traits begin to hit Collection after Collection, to the tune of a cool five stat-boosters.
