Did you know that there’s a fan theory that the reason why Starfleet changes their uniforms every five minutes is so that time travelers will know exactly which decade they’re in when they inevitably have to come back and sort out some shenanigans? It’s just about all I could think of as I look at Control Leland, looking almost identical to Covert Operative Leland, wearing the exact same uniform as Agent Harris a hundred years before, and Agent Sloan a hundred years later. Section 31 just really loves that Folsom Street Fair look, I guess, perhaps as a way to make up for their cookie cutter skill sets. 

With a bonafide top voyage ranking, I wish I could give Control a heartier recommendation, but it’s the most replaceable skill set in the entire game, shackled to a character unlikely to get any more variants, with no Gauntlet chances, and not even the 400% damage ship ability of his older, far less powerful variant to give him fringe use. You’ll like his numbers now, but a lot less in a year’s time when they’ve sagged and you’ve moved on to the new hotness. Look on the bright side, though - Section 31’s show just got green lit, so you’ll at least have a few event mini-bonuses to look forward to!
