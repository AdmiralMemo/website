Did you know that there’s a fan theory that the reason why Starfleet changes their uniforms every five minutes is so that time travelers will know exactly which decade they’re in when they inevitably have to come back and sort out some shenanigans? It’s just about all I could think of as I look at Control Leland, looking almost identical to Covert Operative Leland, wearing the exact same uniform as Agent Harris a hundred years before, and Agent Sloan a hundred years later.

Leland's stats are distributed fairly Base-heavy, but with Disco Mega Events no longer as true as the North Star, he hasn't had too many chances to utilize those Stats on Shuttles. With a middling Collection ceiling, Leland isn’t worth more than a second look.
