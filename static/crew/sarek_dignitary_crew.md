If you were ever curious what petty squabbling with your son, antagonising your wife, and frustrating Tellarites gets you in the long run, the answer is simple - a 900+ Diplomacy base! For some variants, the stat refresh can be aggravating. Is it unfair that an iconic card like Enterprise-E Picard is outpaced by every newer Picard that comes out? Undoubtedly. 

But sometimes, it makes a kind of sense, as it does with this card vs. Ambassador Sarek - this is Sarek at the top of his game, before the Bendii Syndrome, before his Las Vegas shotgun wedding to Perrin, before the illicit Vulcan finger kissing scandals, and as such, he scores double collections, a plus voyage score, a plus skill set, and can even unlock Quinn from his frozen comet node in Episode 10! With fringe benefits like those, this is the kind of Super Rare card you need to be snagging whenever they come up.
