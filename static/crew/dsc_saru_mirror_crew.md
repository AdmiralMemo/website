Is he a butler or is he the main course? Why not both?

Mirror Saru joins the ranks of decrepit Mirror Universe crew that have little to no additional use outside of Trait-based Event bonuses, but at least Saru can count on main cast variant status for weekend work. A sizable DIP Base helps with Shuttle seating there, plus this Saru has an above-average Collection ceiling.
