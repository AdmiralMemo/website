nIb'poH, Spiderman pointing meme, lazy dev work...whatever you want to call it, we have Doug Jones space Ent redux here with a near clone of Saru's previous 2020 gold version Vahar'ai. They're nearly identical with two key differences.

A voyage power refresh which is nice in the immediate and will likely keep him afloat for an extra year or two over his variant contemporary. And a spot in the new-ish Mirror collection. As perhaps the best statted legendary in that group with a sprinkle of event pop to boot, he's your best path to collection glory in the short term. WRG has printed an average of three super rare Mirror crew per year over the last three - if you don't have the patience to wait, then this might be the easiest of the bullets to bite.
