Trelane's alter ego will do fine sketching in a few Sunday Cadet Missions, but it's the Collection value that's worth the price of admission. For a build cost that's fairly Chron-heavy, but pleasantly light on Faction items, you'll add notches to three of the most difficult Collections in game, making Koloth arguably the best Collection package at his rarity level. Perhaps not a leveling target early on, but a name that everyone will be clamoring to Immortalize before too long.
