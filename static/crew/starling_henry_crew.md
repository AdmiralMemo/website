A thick, rich, lush Trait portfolio is often times what veteran players look for in non-Legendary crew. They're the engine of thawpertunities for Events and possible future Collections. In this case, for a crew whose daily work prospects are bleak for a card his age, traits comprise the bulk of Starling's value for everyone. Resourceful wasn't the most likely of his many Traits to hit on the Collection Wheel, but it's probably not the last, as he has three more in the sweet spot of viability. When in doubt, just take a page from the Starling Vocal Band's smash hit, Collection Delight. 

Thinkin' traits is workin' up my appetite 
Looking forward to a little Collection delight 
Rubbin' Borgs and Qs together makes the sparks ignite 
And the thought of citin' crew is getting so exciting 
Ne-ver behold Cartwright 
Collection delight 
Collection delight
