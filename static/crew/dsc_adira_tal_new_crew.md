Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise… I mean of Adira Towel? Long-time players may regale you with the tale of the EDF Adira/Adira Tal art bait and switch, but we won’t spend all our word count on that here.

Adira Tal has aged themselves out of daily use on Voyages, but still remains a very viable Event/Collection card that many elderly players have Fully Fused, so be sure to consider your own roster before investing a Legendary Behold choice on them.

A quartet of current Collections plus another Trait in contention to make it a full five, Adira also pitches in on the weekend due to their strong DIP and ENG Bases for Faction Shuttles, plus main cast billing on Discovery and the aforementioned Traits. Not a bad choice in Legendary Beholds, but no longer an instant selection.
