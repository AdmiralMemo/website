There's not much to unpack for Proto Worf. He's just what he looks like; an event crew worth a spot in your tool belt. Even despite being significantly less versatile than his big brothers, the Guv and the sailor, Worf/Klingon events will always have enough CMD/SEC seats to still justify taking this primal stud in a pinch, especially since he still shares the #3 Klingon SEC with Janeway. With traits he's well into double-digit events and is still a capable shuttle pilot, despite offering little else.
