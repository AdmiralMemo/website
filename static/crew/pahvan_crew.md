We’ve taken too many Ls trying to guess on Discovery megas so let’s set that to the side for the time being. Pahvan’s skill set has some voyage all-stars in it, from the 2023 duo of Devious Jurati and Terrors Troi (who sound like a couple of 80’s wrestlers) to the coveted voyage exclusive Simple Simon van Gelder. But skill set is only part of the voyage equation and Pahvan, while serviceable there, lags behind slightly in skill order efficacy and has a dramatically lower anti-matter chance than those particular names.

A reasonable contributor there and in Fleet Boss Battles, that all takes a backseat to their collection value. A top ten name on debut with a couple viable traits in the hopper, this is a crew who will top many players’ retrieval lists in the future, considering their pack debut. By then, you may be retrieving Pahvan *only* for their collection value, but it should still be worth it.
