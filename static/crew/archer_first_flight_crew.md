Still sporting his shiner from brawling with noted “one of the worst crew ever on debut” A.G. Robinson, Fist Fight Archer… wait, I mean First Flight Archer… enters Star Trek Timelines as the newest Gauntlet Exclusive Legendary.

Somebody needs to teach WRG the difference between a Thief and Smuggler, since by their flavor text’s own wording, Archer STEALS the NX-Beta, and unless stealing a ship and piloting it counts as “self-smuggling”, he ain’t a Smuggler!  It’s also pretty clear he’s wearing an extravehicular suit (a very bright-colored one), but has no inclusion in the A Little Stroll collection.  Perhaps a trait audit one day will rectify these? 

Jon is seeing a bit of a renaissance in January 2023 with a top voyager (Federation President) and a new Gauntlet Exclusive… one must wonder if one of the developers has faith of the heart!  As with all the other jackpot crew, he has massive proficiencies that will get your gauntlet team traveling at the speed of Warp 3 as soon as you can get lucky enough to snag a copy.

His CMD/DIP top two rolls are the same as prior featured jackpot Balok, so they’ll go toe to toe when crits are equal.  CMG/ENG (his primary/tertiary rolls) used to be a bit of a wasteland, with only Captain Braxton and EV Suit Picard the only real oases, but now Archer dominates without peer there.  On release, Archer doesn’t have the overwhelming 65% crit sets that Tribbled Koloth and Korax and Balok received, but surely they will be added in the next few weeks, and at that time this note will be updated to reflect this accordingly.  In existing sets, he claims 25% crit in an amazing 27 gauntlets (second only to Red Angel with 30), and 45% in two. 
Yes, he is indeed missing from the EV Suit collection, but he does have 3 on launch (including “A New Challenger Approaches”), with 4 more viable traits that could easily be added to future collections.
For those who somehow don’t have any better options, Archer does have a +10 Attack ship ability, coupled with a triggerless 400% instant damage ability at 8s.  It’s slow and limited to two uses, so unless somehow you’re missing Killy or her clones, or TACO Mayweather, he probably won’t find his way onto your Skirmish or Arena crew.

Before long, you’ll be seeing walls of Fist Fight… I mean First Flight Archer (I did it again!) in gauntlet, so enjoy his absence while you can!
