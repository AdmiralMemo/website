Long lambasted by players for milquetoast stats and being ugly as sin, Martok's art glow up has at least solved part of the equation. Boring from most angles, but with a few Trait-fueled options, Ol' Blue Eye is a crew you wish was a Super Rare that you could thaw twice a year, rather than have him hog a Crew Slot.

If you're keeping him on your active roster anyways, his six (!!!) different 45% Gauntlet sets and hard-hitting 65% set are fine for a lark or as an early-game option, given his limited Proficiencies and stiff Skill set competition.

It's almost a shame that this card is such a Collection hoss, and yet... Opinions are changing on him due to the power that Collection Stat boosts wield in the late game. If that’s the only reason you choose this card from a Behold (or Retrieve), it’s a good one. And if you’re still in a position to benefit from his occasional Gauntlet or weekend offerings, feel free to indulge in this refreshingly interesting vintage of 2279 Martok.
