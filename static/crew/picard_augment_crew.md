The voyage work and general utility outside of a vanity collection spot isn't there anymore for one of several fake Picards, but he still has a TV series and a medley of interesting traits to look forward to which should provide plenty of weekend work. If you're looking for a prognostication for a pair that packs a punch in 2020 and beyond, Burnham and Picard are the names to watch.
