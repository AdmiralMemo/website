At first glance, it’s hard to get particularly excited about an alleged ‘Augment’ Picard that has such unimpressive stats, but appearances can be deceiving, so I’d caution you against sleeping on this sprightly old man. With Picard events still in the offing and a vanity collection spot that can look mighty appealing compared to some rather more useless crew, there’s definitely value to be found in the #2 Picard SEC variant - yep, even after all this time, he’s still got some of the biggest guns of any John Luck Pickerd. Handy if you didn't feel like playing six pack spin for Sinister Picard, and definitely worth snagging in a pinch.
