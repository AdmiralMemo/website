After WRG shocked us all with voyage monster and all-around stud Prisoner Kim, in Fair Haven Kim they've quickly reset our expectations back to the underwhelming and unremarkable Harry variants we've come to expect over the years.

If you're looking for positives outside of that dapper outfit, both of Kim's bases are variant-best, though that again speaks less to his quality and more to how horrid most Harry variants are (looking at you especially, Rogue Harry). Still, it will serve him well on Kim weekends, which historically have been about two a year, though it's worth noting that the past events Fair Haven Kim would have qualified for includes only one full Faction and three Faction hybrids.

Sadly, with no collections, Gauntlet work, or notable Arena ability, for most rosters Kim is destined to be left holding the bouquet in cryostasis.
