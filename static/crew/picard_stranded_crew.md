It’s hard to recommend Cadet Voyage ability too strongly when they’re so easily outclassed by higher Rarity options, but when it comes attached to an otherwise versatile crew - saddle up!

Stellar Voyage metrics, the top Rare DIP Base, and four fat Collections is exactly the kind of bite-sized Cadet Lunchables that will satisfy even a veteran player’s hunger. Pour one out for his lack of weekend Cadet eligibility, if he was wearing a bra and had ridges on his head, he might be the best Rare crew in the game.
