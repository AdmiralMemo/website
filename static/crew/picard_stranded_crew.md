It’s hard to recommend cadet voyage ability too strongly when they’re so easily outclassed by higher rarity options, but when it comes attached to an otherwise versatile crew - saddle up!

Stellar voyage metrics, the top Rare DIP base, and four fat collections is exactly the kind of bite-sized cadet Lunchables that will satisfy even a veteran player’s hunger. Pour one out for his lack of weekend cadet eligibility, if he was wearing a bra and had ridges on his head, he might be the best Rare crew in the game.
