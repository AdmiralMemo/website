Jaris' claim to fame, aside from being Piglet's boss, is on Ships. One of the 400% Instant Damage folks coming online at a speedy six seconds, he’ll find value there unless WRG shakes up the meta and introduces an even faster version. Otherwise, Redjac’s Trait list is thin and may provide only a duo of Collections when all is said and done. Pick from Beholds if you don’t already have better Ship Battle options.
