Troi has accrued quite a large number of variants over the years Timelines has been going, and, as the saying goes, to thine own self be true, because just like poor old Deanna, they tend to vary a lot in usefulness. Bridge Officer is definitely on the weaker side of the spectrum, her CMD base a lowly third to Dark Empath and Durango for variants and her MED stat just lacking oomph compared to more recent cards. That being said, a crew with any amount of MED/CMD will never truly be useless, and while her bases aren't great, they're definitely still useable in her steady clip of events. Her early game Gauntlet and voyage presence will leave you with fond memories when it becomes time to freeze her.
