Stargazer Picard can only be found in the Honor Hall, and offers little that your other Common Crew available in the Time Portal can’t. In the early game your Honor is too valuable to spend on him, but as an oddity he is the strongest Common Voyager. You also don’t need him to complete the Common Crew Collection, but if his Tactician or Astrophysicist Traits ever get Collections, it MAY be worth the 1,500 Honor to pick him up.
