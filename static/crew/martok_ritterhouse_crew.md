Unimpressive Voyage metrics, a paucity of Traits, and an unattractive Skill stack for a Martok variant mean that Roy is a niche pick for actual daily use, so choose wisely, friends. Unless, of course, you just really want that J.G. Hertzler chewing a cigar like he chews scenery avatar - I could think of far less reasonable uses of your hard earned resources.
