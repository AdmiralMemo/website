Gross Stats and a redundant Skill set spell out that he’s not a daily use crew, but Garak may just barely make the grade as the weakest possible crew who’s still Event-relevant. A thicc Event history littered with Trait and variant bonuses include a handful of big bonus features, none of which are re-runs.

His value in Collections should grow over time and combined with his big bonus features make him a fine option to passively add stars on in otherwise poor Beholds.
