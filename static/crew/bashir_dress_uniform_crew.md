Welcome to Star Trek Timelines, where the points are made up and the Traits don’t matter - or just don’t make sense. Despite being on Section 31 business at the time, he doesn’t count for either that Faction or as an Undercover Operative, which is something of a shame.

That being said, a respectable Event tally and the usual Engineered/Physician Bashir Collections still make for an extensive portfolio, and as a long term project, he's worth fusing when possible.
