Well, it happened. Anson Mounted a Pike comeback, resulting in several Pike Event bumps since his introduction in Star Trek: Discovery, Season Two. With the silver fox locked in for another Trek series, this Jeff Hunter Pike variant will have his chances to sword-n-board his way onto a few more weekend Shuttles, despite bad Bases.

His usage/power is too poor otherwise except on Ships. A combination of +10 Attack and fast Activation is not particularly common and would be fine for Ship Battles if the opportunity cost to Fuse him wasn't so high.
