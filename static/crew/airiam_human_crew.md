Nothing particular exciting about Airiam aside from her fantastic attire for beachwear. A lack of proficiencies hurts her voyaging power and although her SCI base is decent it's not enough to prioritise her over better cards. No traits, no collection and a poor ship ability hinder her usefulness aside from a few SCI based shuttles here and there.
