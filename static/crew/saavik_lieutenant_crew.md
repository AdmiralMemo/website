She might change looks quicker than a shapeshifter at a swinging convention but the Kirsty Alley look alike here will keep working on cadet missions all weekend. Not just that but her #8 SCI and #10 CMD base guarantees her places on most of your voyages. Keep in mind however she will require a fair few faction or hard to find items but if you are looking to improve voyage times and score a point in the Vulcan collection then itâ€™s worth investing.
