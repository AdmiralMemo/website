Without peeking, do you know RAF Miles' release date? Would you have guessed mid-2016? Few crew have a more sterling reputation, but like his buddy Clive strafing the Jerries over the channel, he's earned every inch of it. Base and voyage numbers that were ostentatous for their time have settled into the average-to-good range and he's even picked up a post-release collection to go with Jury Rigger. The O'Brien event clip remains modest, but a pair of variant-best bases still make him a key piece to acquire.
