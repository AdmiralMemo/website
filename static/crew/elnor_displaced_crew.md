Did anyone ask for a new Elnor? I didn’t, but someone must be enamored with this Evan Evagora Elnor portrayal, so we got a new Super Rare. Yes, he checks most of the boxes on a Super Rare: solid Voyage power on debut for the early game Timelines player, a strong enough Primary Base to make him viable to thaw from Cryostasis for Trait-based Events (cause you know we aren’t getting Elnor Events, sorry), and enough Collections (four) to sate the hunger of the elderly Collection-focused player. Elnor also has a nice little Ship Ability for the early game player, featuring a 250% Instant Damage with a quick Cycle time. Finish, Freeze, and mostly Forget?
