You can have your ice cream and eat it too with this Legendary Xahean - Queen Po! She tops her frozen dessert with so many Traits and Event chances you’ll forget that her Voyage rank is now basically empty calories.

A sick pack of Collections buoy her Event chances, including her Discovery hidden Trait which has resulted in many Mega Events in the past and now gives lasting value with a show Collection. She could even find two more Collections in the couch cushions before long. 

You’ll be pleased with Po’s work even from star 1, as she contributes solidly towards Fleet Boss Battle Node solving, and feel free to use your Quantum to Fuse her up to get those global Stat boosts from her Collections.
