Eenie, queenie, miney...ah forget it. ENG is the new DIP, it seems, as DB showered us in big ENG bases throughout 2019. In other words, if you've got a fiver, DB has an "authentic" Rolex for you. Her event count reads like a Kirk or Jadzia, but might be a house of cards with Discovery as her primary weekend consideration and a motley assortment of traits. Naturally her ENG would rank highly among all of them, but depending solely on traits for event bonuses is playing a risky game. Somewhat more encouraging is her voyage ability which helps boost a skill pairing which has gained representation lately, but is still on the uncommon side.

We're obligated to remind you that Po was a prior campaign offering, but that doesn't dent her value as much as others as her primary consideration was always voyages. Po's double collections for a single star were worth it for players who snagged four copies at once and might be a nice cherry on top if you still need Jury Rigger help.
