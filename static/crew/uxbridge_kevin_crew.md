I chose not to fight.' 'I will not kill.' Thus, a SEC Proficiency was born.

Kev has a big boy Base, but little else. You can count on one hand the number of 3-Skill Legendary crew who have ever debuted with worse Voyage numbers than the aged Douwd and while his Skill set is underrepresented overall, he shouldnâ€™t be the one flying that flag on your roster.

A good-for-Super-Rare Attack Boost on Ships and eclectic Trait mash-up rounds out his thin portfolio. Surely Kevin's strong SCI Base will give you chances to use this fan favorite, just don't treat this Allen Wrench like do-it-all duct tape.
