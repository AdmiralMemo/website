'I chose not to fight.' 'I will not kill.' Thus, a SEC proficiency was born.

Kev has a big boy base, but little else. With the top SCI ranks stuffed full of household names like Dax, Spock, Janeway, Kira, and Picard, you'd be trading in oodles of utility for a base in Uxbridge that's stronger by just a couple percent.

Only one 3-skill legendary crew has ever debuted with worse voyage numbers than the aged Douwd and while he may still float above some two year old crew in voyage power, it takes away another avenue for future use and puts a short timer on his usefulness there.

A good-for-super-rare arena attack boost and eclectic trait mash-up rounds out his thin portfolio. Surely Kevin's strong SCI base will give you chances to use this fan favorite, just don't treat an Allen Wrench like do-it-all duct tape.
