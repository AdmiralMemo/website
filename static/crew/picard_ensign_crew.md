Sporting a strong CMD base and suspiciously shiny portrait, this particular Picard is perhaps a little generic, but still quite a nice bonus for those lucky enough to snag him from dilemmas. Mostly a weekend warrior, netting you Picard bonuses that are going to multiply as we get closer to Sir Patrickâ€™s resurrection to the small screen. A boring skill set, no collections and a bad ship ability hold him back from better utility.
