Lwaxana Troi’s Rare variant’s true value comes from Cadet Missions on the weekend to help you Warp them once you move past early game status. Ancillary value includes some fringe Ship Battle use with some of your first big chunks of Crit Bonus as well as a slot in one Collection outside of her Rarity one. Will Ambassador and Telepath Traits ever pay off with Collections due to overlap with Diplomats and Vulcans? One might think WRG might run out of Traits one day and turn to those.
