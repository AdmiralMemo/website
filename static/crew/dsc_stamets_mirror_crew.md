Everybody's favorite Uncle Jesse, played by John Stamets, was a total hoss upon release. One of the earlier ENG/MED crew, the evil exomycologist carried the banner of top Disco SCI through an event-loaded 2019. He's since come back to earth rank-wise, but punches up with a skill set to lift a mediocre voyage score and a fantastic event clip, even if variant weekends have been sparse. His trait mix is thinner than it appears at first glance, but with useful voyage and event offerings, he's a fine crew to behold or even cite.
