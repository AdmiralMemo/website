What you might call the King of the Might Have Been, Mirror Stamets used to be very highly regarded in these parts, but time and missed opportunities have worn him down. Perhaps the least desirable third Skill for an ENG/MED Skill set combines with barren Traits, decrepit Voyage power, and overstuffed SCI Base ranks to make him a candidate for the Cryostasis Vault once you get around to collecting all five stars.

His Event history, which you can consult to see why he drifted at higher Tier altitudes in days of yore, is stuffed with the previously-frequent Discovery Mega Events. Without strong supplemental Traits, the Mirror Universe is his best conduit toward non-variant bonuses, even after two Mega Events of its own.
