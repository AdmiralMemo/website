To borrow an expression, why does this crew need to be? We'll get to her standalone merits in a moment, but as a Burnham variant, she brings nothing to the table that can't be obtained in better amounts elsewhere. 

She has a strong CMD base to go with Burnham's dependable Event history, but her strong overall ranking is somewhat muted by being tethered to a character which covers that skill quite well on Shuttles already. And the CMD/DIP/SUCK skill set makes Cap'n Burnham victim number 200-something, neutering an already mediocre power level for a new crew release. 

That being said, there is readily apparent value in a crew who gets the Burnham spotlight and owns a strong base and slots in four Collections, with chances for two more (where is the Explorer Collection, Ben?!). She will earn Shuttle work, but just be aware that that may be a secondary benefit for a character that you just like - there are more useful options out there if you're looking purely at gameplay potential.
