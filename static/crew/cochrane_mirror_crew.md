A skill set that used to be rarer, voyage power that used to be useful, and 'dual 1k bases' which used to headline. Now slumped in the stat rank doldrums, Zef's primary benefit is a gorgeous, double-digit smörgåsbord of traits which have provided a respectable number of event chances while promising more down the line. His other upside, dual collections, is in a holding pattern while we see to what extent WRG extends collection thresholds.

There's a chance of sporadic voyage work for the average roster, but fusion capital for that purpose would be better spent elsewhere. Bound to pop up in shuttles when you least expect it, Face Fuzz Cochrane is a fine low-end behold choice to save your bacon if you're looking at some other stinker behold choices.
