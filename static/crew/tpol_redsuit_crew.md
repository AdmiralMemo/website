T’Pol stands out among Uncommon Crew with five days of Cadet Mission eligibility during weekdays, which is one of the main things you want crew of her Rarity to be able to do. A strong SCI Base to go with a serviceable DIP Base gives her utility in the Galaxy Map, as well as on Voyages and Shuttles until you can Freeze her in favor of higher Rarity Crew. Be also sure to enjoy early game notches on her two non-Rarity Collections, and look for her to add to another once the Content Train™ pulls up to that Trait’s station.
