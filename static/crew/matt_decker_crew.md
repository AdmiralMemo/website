The primary reason to choose this card is to put him on your Bridge Crew with Demo Man Scotty, Frantic McCoy, and Chances Taken Kirk. 

Skipping secondary and tertiary reasons (there are none), Matt owns a single 45% Gauntlet set, a peculiarly low SECondary Base, single Collection spot, and wields a 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability at eight seconds which is both handy and increasingly easy to find elsewhere.
