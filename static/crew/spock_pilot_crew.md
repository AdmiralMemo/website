Talos IV Spock requires an insane number of Faction Items to Equip him fully, so even though he is one of the strongest Rare Voyagers, you may want to wait until you’re more well-established in the game before you devote resources to him. He’ll pay off the investment with a strong Collection ROI, having the Traits to offer up three non-Rarity notches, with one certain future inclusion and one on more shaky ground.
