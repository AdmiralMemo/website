Socrates' primary selling point (aside from gorgeous art reminiscent of a classical chess piece carved from ivory) was once a hefty voyage score, but now this Greek philosopher is getting as old as the culture from which he spawned. Take heart though, as it’s not all bad news for ol’ So-crates…

WRG has shown tremendous favoritism to Socrates’ Traits, giving him a strong Event history for a one-off name and a reasonable Collection portfolio as well. A small perk slanted toward newer players; five different 45% Gauntlets. Mediocre Proficiency power limits him to affection choice in most cases, but there are worse crew arts to display proudly. His Event/Collection one-two combination and that niche Gauntlet utility combine to soften the blow as he tumbles ever so gracefully from Voyage viability.
