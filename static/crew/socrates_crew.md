Socrates' primary selling point (aside from gorgeous art reminiscent of a classical chess piece carved from ivory) is a prodigious voyage score. It will hang out in the double-digit ranks for years, ensuring a long term return on any citation investments.

Of course, CMD/DIP/SCI has also become a rather bloated skill set for legendary crew. Socrates sits among (and above) a bevy of names in the voyage power ranks which include four mega crew, four campaign crew, and global gift Mambo Picard, not to mention fistfuls of former event crew. He outworks and will outlast most of those names on voyages, but with slimmer value over replacement than other skill sets offer, the improvement may be marginal for advanced rosters.

Another small perk slanted toward newer players; five different 45% gauntlets. Mediocre proficiency power limits him to affection choice in most cases, but there are worse crew arts to display proudly. His efforts there, as well as modest arena and collection value act as garnish for his daily voyage contributions.
