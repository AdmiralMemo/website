Deanna de Vil, Deanna de Vil, if she canâ€™t have Alkar, then nobody will. Dark Empath Troi has (not prematurely like Deanna) aged out of Voyages and variant Events have gotten quiet as of late. A solid number of untapped Traits may give this crew longer life overall, but choose from Beholds carefully.
