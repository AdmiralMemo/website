Much like his dreamboat on-screen character, The Outrageous Okona gives us just what we want - gauntlet and voyage work from a one-off name. There may be a bit of shuttle work in the cards thanks to his rogueish trait set, but modest bases instead allow room for more frequent dice rolling as he leverages two middle-strength rolls into the top DIP/ENG pair, affording you the chance to smack The Caretaker around.

Some turn of the decade crew have helped bolster the DIP/ENG voyage ranks, but it's still a skill pair on the thinner side, giving Okona above average returns there. The Thad-of-all-trades is fine behold value, even if he lacks name recognition.
