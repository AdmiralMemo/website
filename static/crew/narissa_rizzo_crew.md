The "toned down" version of Narissa, let's say, is equally unassuming in game. Her blips come in the form of thin value in the Arena, Traits, and a solitary Collection. On ships, an Evasion handicap and Attack boost capped at +8 is compensated for by an excellent Initialization time and healthy Duration. She can be a usable stopgap Attack booster for players in the early game. 

The most deceptive aspect of this undercover Romulan is her set of Traits. Between the bloated Human/Fed/Starfleet and extremely niche Romulan-adjacent Traits which are unlikely to trigger anything, Undercover Operative is her sole long-term play. Once you have her finished, you can likely freeze and forget.
