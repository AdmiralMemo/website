Ah, the Legendary version of Miss Q we were missing during the Q mega, arriving fashionably late! A healthy DIP base gives the Civil War mistress a decent prospect for shuttles should events from the Q mega re-appear. But, as always, due to the sheer number of crew who can fill CMD/DIP/SCI seats in any combination that have better numbers in all areas, it’s just too hard to recommend her for a job in such a skilled field.

She has potential if you are after someone to fill a daily requisition shuttle whilst the rest of the roster are busy but in a pairing which has both Pah-Wraith Keiko and Professor Sato I don’t fancy her chances to make an impression should the rare occasion another Q Continuum event turn up.
