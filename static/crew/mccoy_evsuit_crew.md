The first of the ultra patriotic TOS red, white, and blue EV suits in game (or the more proper order of blue, white, and red for Picard's sensibilities), that would seem to be the most original offering that McCoy has for us this time around. 

This variant's debut event marks McCoy's tenth time in the weekend limelight, but only three of those opportunities have included shuttles, which may somewhat limit EV Suit's chances at use if history continues (or his glut of Galaxies are re-run). With traits best pointed at voyages, you may have to pick and choose your spots for thawing. 

Voyager power on the wrong side of usable, even for a purple, should still find use on the right rosters thanks to a plus skill set, but most certainly has a clock on it. Dual collection generally earn their keep while sitting in the leveling queue, especially early on in the EV Suit collection's lifetime. On the whole he's nice to have, but non-essential in almost every aspect.
