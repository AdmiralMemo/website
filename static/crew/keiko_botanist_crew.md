One skill crew (who aren’t a top base) can be hard to justify. So it is with Keiko, who can’t be counted on for any tangible benefit day to day. Her pair of stat boosting collections is notable for a low rarity card, just make sure that you can handle the number of Science Experiments required to finish her - in the early game those are usually better spent on crew who contribute to your active roster.
