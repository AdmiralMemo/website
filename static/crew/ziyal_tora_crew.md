Two 'usable' Bases (when bonus) puts her near the top of a couple different Traits' 'best of' lists. If/when they crop up, she'll be a valuable weekend resource, but until then Ziyal is almost a total dud of an investment.

Something in the four to five Collection range is firmly within her possible outcomes and it would be hard to catch *fewer* Events going forward, but as youâ€™ve probably guessed, Ziyal is far more theoretical value than realized potential.
