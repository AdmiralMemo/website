The arguments to be had about the exclusion of this Barclay from Holodeck Enthusiasts while recovering addict Commander Barclay gets in is a conversation for the ages - long after you've fully equipped, levelled and frozen this unfortunately nothing card. Middle of the pack bases and sub-par voyage power mean that poor Cyrano is limited to squeezing in on the action on the odd Barclay event, and not a lot else.

If Innovator ever gets expanded, he's liable to gain retroactive value, but as it stands now, like de Bergerac, his statistical ugliness prevents him from achieving his dream of being loved by even an ugly woman.
