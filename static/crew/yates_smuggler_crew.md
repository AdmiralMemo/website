Yates had her moment in Timelines history when she was the only non-Portal Super Rare Jury Rigger to help complete that tricky Collection, but how she's merely a short string of Traits. Freeze and forget like most low end Super Rares; maybe thaw her once a year if her bonus lines up with a situation where you'll be sending waves of requisition Shuttles.
