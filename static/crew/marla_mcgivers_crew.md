There was a time when Marla was a favorite of the B I G B A S E segment of the playerbase, but her way forward is going to be appealing to the “follow the Traits” sect. A reasonable DIP Base will almost always play for Events (if she ever gets them), including a re-run of one of her features, but as those have been extremely sparse so far, you’re probably just eyeing her Trait set to provide Collection value.

She doesn’t have ‘sleeping giant’ potential like certain other Trait-rich crew, but Marla could certainly pop up with three or four Collections under her belt before you realize it.
