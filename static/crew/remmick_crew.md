Remmick's top ten Gauntlet pair, even in one of the most crowded Skill sets, and a handful of 45% Gauntlets might be enough to save him from the airlock for newer players. Beyond that, his ceiling is as Trait Event shuttle fodder for Investigator or Undercover Operative weekends.

That being said, is it even worth hanging onto this card when his art doesnâ€™t include a stagehand kneeling behind him blowing into a straw connected to the back of his prosthetic neck?
