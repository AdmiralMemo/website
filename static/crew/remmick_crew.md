Remmick's top ten gauntlet pair, even in one of the most crowded skill sets, and a couple of 45% gauntlets might be enough to save him from the airlock for newer players. Beyond that, his ceiling is as trait event shuttle fodder for Investigator or Undercover Operative; the latter of which may be too big to be viable before he gets his chance. Not a recommend hold for rosters in the mid-to-late game.
