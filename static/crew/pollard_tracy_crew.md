If you are an elderly player, you remember how clutch Dr. Pollard and Reverend Phlox were for your MED/CMD Voyages for literally YEARS. If you are a new player, asking in your fleet Discord, “Should I take a Dr. Pollard in this Legendary Behold?”, please take a look at this crew note first and don’t listen to the elderly players who are looking back at her with a rose-colored VISOR.

Yes, Pollard has a fantastic Skill set, one that if she were released again today with 2023 numbers, she would be an instacite and maybe dupe candidate. However, her Skill set no longer matters much with 2019 Voyage power, and she’s left as the sum of her Traits. 

A trio of Collections is all she’s likely to ever get, and while those Traits we mentioned do include the hidden “dsc” Trait that gave her so many Mega Event bonuses, it’s unlikely to ever reach the 2017-2019 heights, despite a resurrection in December 2022. You can safely take her from a Legendary Behold if your other options are very bad, and don’t let your elderly player peers say “Back in my day, Pollard was the best blah blah blah…”
