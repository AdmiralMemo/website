A late bloomer, Pollard only stands out more over time as other skill sets explode in their number of options while strong medics remain as rare as latinum. The good doctor was 2019's sole addition to the ranks of MED/CMD crew and we thank Qod that she's a good one.

Voyages are the main course here. Fret not a slipping voyage total - as the only game in town, her value over replacement options is monstrous and even if you collect the only other MED/CMD crew available from beholds, a duplicate 5/5 Pollard would still be auto-include for MED/CMD voyages on any roster. Exclusivity plus a powerful MED primary will have her standing out from the crowd, if her bleached white uniform doesn't do the trick.

We pump the brakes a bit when it comes to shuttles. She sits atop an absurdly thin slate of 'MED and CMD' seating options and has collected fistfuls of event bonuses from the Discovery trait, but the downsides are big - 'MED and CMD' seats are rare and the Discovery event bubble, as always, could burst at any time leaving Pollard with some ugly trait options in its wake. There's a (good?) chance that Pollard won't blow the roof off shuttles the way she has in the past, but everyone should try to collect options for a diverse and deep shuttle roster and Pollard is #1A for her skill pair and can pick up work even without bonuses.
