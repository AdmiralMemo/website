One Ron Canada (what a name) brought to life a loveable/hateable Malon from Voyager who unfortunately is only +1 to a collection. The lure of otherwise useful arena evasion is shot down by an attack handicap leaving his best chance at usability residing in the bowels of a Romantic mega where heâ€™s the top super rare ENG for that trait.
