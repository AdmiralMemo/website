“Hailing frequencies open, Captain.”

“Hello, Captain Picard. I’m listening.” 

If only those were lines in his episode!

His numbers don't have a semblance of a pulse anymore and there's seemingly only one shot at contributing here. It's not hard to see a third repeat of his Event feature, perhaps giving you an easy way to snag a star on a frankly bad card, but going by his Traits, that's the upper limit of his chances at relevance. If you select him, it's only because he's Frasier Crane.
