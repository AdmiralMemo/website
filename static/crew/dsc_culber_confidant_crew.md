You’d be confident too if you had as many abs as Wilson Cruz. Goddamn, dude, leave some for the rest of us. Oh, Confidant…my bad. As the filthy casuals go off to google “wilson cruise topless”, let’s break down the rest of this crew. Imagine if Dr. Hugh Culber had a third Skill. That’s it. That’s the card.

The middle layer of honey-roasted DIP should help with Shuttle seating for Culber’s scant Event chances in the years since 2019 when Discovery Mega Events were largely culled. Aged out of Voyages for the most part, at least Culber is Traity; three Collections in the bag with a likely ceiling of a whole handful (that’s five, in case a Simpsons character is reading this). Not a top choice from a Legendary Behold, but mid-level, and may even break into your Crew Retrieval list.
