As one of the very first Premium Campaign offerings, Leland was spotted in many Gauntlets and on many Arena and Skirmish ships due to his reasonable Proficiencies and occasional Crit Bonuses, as well as a 400% Instant Damage Ability Activating at a decent 8s. Sadly there are now far better options available in both of these places, but if you find a copy of Leland early he could anchor you there for a short time.

Time has also ravaged his Event chances, since Discovery Mega Events are largely a thing of the past, but you might still find him pitching in when his Traits hit Event paydirt. Look for enduring value while heâ€™s in Cryostatic slumber if his remaining viable Traits find Collections one day.
