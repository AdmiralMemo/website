Whether it’s Sir Mix-a-Lot or Meghan Trainor, many songs have already been penned about Scotty. As Paul Stubbs would put it, “One great base and the crowd rises. A brand new era in engineering.” Dethroning Ahdar Ru’afo’s near four year reign atop the ENG charts, Scotty does it with one skill tied behind his back.

There isn’t much to say about Scott that you can’t already tell by looking at him. A shuttle monster, Demo Man is deficient just about everywhere else. There’s certainly some value in his thematic arena ability, which is an easier to use version of Lt. Commander Mitchell’s (Big league company). Whether you want to pair him with various instant damage crew, some long lasting crit options, or eschew him in favor of the traditional KillyKillyKillyKilly setup is up to you.
