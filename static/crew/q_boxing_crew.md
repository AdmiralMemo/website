“I’m not Picard.” And then Q never visited DS9 ever again. Another CMD/DIP/SEC re-print, this pompous pugilist’s prognosis predisposes precarious productivity. In short, bound for the freezer and thawed for event use every half a year or thereabouts. Without a ton more Qs available from the source material, his help in completing The Continuum collection should be safe for a while.
