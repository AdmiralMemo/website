“I’m Not Picard” he says and gosh Benjamin, you are darned right, because at least most Picard variants are useful. Okay that was harsh, I genuinely enjoy this moment between Q and Sisko. Sadly, however, this card was never going to be a knockout star.

If he were to get into the ring with a bunch of other SEC/CMD crew and have battle royale to find who wins that prestigious title to board a failed voyage, the “Jambalaya Frya” would probably be knocked out in the first few bouts. His fighting moves are sublime, but when you are up against heavyweight champions of the sport like High Roller Sisko and Redjac “Dark Devil” Jaris then you had best quickly find the bookie and rescind that bet. His signature move is a decent 325% gut punch in the Arena, but with an eight second reaction time you’ll probably find he’s not as quick to react as the big 400% hitters in that arena. Tell him to throw in the towel before he gets beaten to the back of the cite list.
