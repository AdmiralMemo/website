Breen Disguise Kira is from the episode where Dukat sits on a giant spike and she has to pull it out of his ass. But just in case you need any more reason to acquire her...

This Kira is going to keep skill set fanatics up at night. Not since Kahless the Unforgettable three and a half years ago (before voyages existed) have we seen a CMD/DIP/SEC crew appear this high in the overall voyage ranks. Warnings about that bloated skill set are sprinkled throughout dozens of other crew notes and discuss concepts such as value over replacement, but cards at this power level have historically only dropped about a rank per year and that's a different kind of value.

Valuable, too, is the Kira name which sits among the event leaders and this version offers two worthwhile bases for those weekends including the top Kira SEC. She'll easily be manning event shuttles into 2022 if she's even fallen out of the top ten voyagers by then.

To help round her out, a handful of plus traits fall in the right bonus pool size for further event speculation and give her a 45% gauntlet trait set wherein she would have a few ranked pairs, but is still bested be some more common names.
