Layna (not named in episode), Helmsman Wyatt (not named at all), Vargas, both of Geordi's parents....legendaries all. Fajo? Not so much.

Even for a 'super rare', Fajo disappoints. The skill set and a smattering of intriguing traits polish the card somewhat, but without long term event or collection perks, his numbers simply aren't good enough to justify more than perfunctory investment.

A younger roster may utilize his underrepresented skill combo for voyages in the short term and beyond that, we are all reliant on the wheel of traits to pluck him from cryostasis in the future.
