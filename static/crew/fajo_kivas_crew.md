Layna (not named in episode), Helmsman Wyatt (not named at all), Vargas, both of Geordi's parents....Legendaries all. Fajo? Not so much.

Even for a 'Super Rare', Fajo disappoints. His smattering of intriguing Traits (which is missing another half dozen) polish the card somewhat, but until his Collections perk reaches its potential, his numbers simply aren't good enough to justify more than perfunctory investment.
