Like his alter ego Nexus Kirk, he's an ok stopgap for the early game Gauntlet with a usable SEC roll, though he has a fair bit of Skill set competition. That ordinary Skill set and aged power doesn't translate to Voyages, but Kirk Events are plentiful and other variants are not replete with DIP options. With a token Collection attached, one more viable Trait, and some minor Arena chances (again, for new players), there's some value here from multiple angles, if not the power you can expect from newer releases.
