Formerly an all-star at the Super Rare level, the game has since seen plenty of the Base/Voyage/Event triad types, pushing top shelf crew to have something extra on their résumé to stand out; this Burnham does not.

Still a vaunted Event name in Timelines, Burnham offers almost nothing else of value and has been particularly hampered by a pathetic Trait lineup that’s missing Vulcan. She may snag a Collection or two in the future, but this is a Finish and Freeze piece just waiting for the next Faction bonus in order to pitch in.
