This unjoined Ezri has been grandfathered into Dax Events, but the point is usually moot with Bases too weak for even requisitioning Shuttles on most rosters. The Mirror Universe Trait holds the bulk of her value and while she may end up with a tidy number of Collections before too long, only late game players should consider that a reasonable pay-off for a build cost that gobbles up Terran Empire Faction Items.
