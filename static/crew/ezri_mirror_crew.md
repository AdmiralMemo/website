There was a time when the joining of Dax and Mirror events would have made us weak in the knees, but time has not been kind to Ezriâ€™s bases. Even now, in the midst of what is likely her last chance for a multi-week impact in the Scoundrel mega, her upper limit is probably requisition shuttle for many rosters.
