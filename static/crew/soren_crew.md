Not just missing some would-be useful Traits like Maverick or Hero, but also any semblance of usability too, Soren is merely a short bundle of Traits waiting for WRG to favor them in the form of Collections or Events. As their Ship Ability suggests, they offer nothing that canâ€™t be found attached to more capable crew, leaving them as a Trait dart throw in dead-end Legendary Beholds.
