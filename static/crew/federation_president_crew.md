A good Stats comparison would ironically be Chancellor Gorkon whose primary Base and Voyage numbers are both within single digits. Having debuted as a 'daily use' option in the worst Skill set, we knew Rigatoni's shelf life was short and he's used up that leeway for sure.

Now a Collection option only, Ravioli will pop up rarely with a weekend bonus, but his overall limitations are quite obvious and he'll remain a low-end Behold option over crew with zero long term value.
