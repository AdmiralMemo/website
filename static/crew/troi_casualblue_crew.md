Deanna’s reasonable daily utility for new players is somewhat muted by a build cost that requires dozens of faction items. She’s an acceptable option for clearing both Saturday and Sunday cadet nodes and may pitch in on voyages and in the gauntlet for some weeks, but has dreadful long term value. Troi is an informed choice at best for your valuable early game resources. Her strengths are better suited to high rarity crew.
