Pavel wins the booby prize for most boring trait set possible in game, but there ends his notoriety in Timelines. Even his build cost is rated on the expensive side for basic crew. How bad is it when even a Common Ensign Kim is your superior?  Donâ€™t spend any time on this crew except to finish the Common Crew Collection.
