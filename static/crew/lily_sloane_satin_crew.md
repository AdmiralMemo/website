Miss Lily does have "Variants" and an "Event count", but with neither being impressive, nor her aged Voyage power, the Gauntlet is perhaps her best chance for 'real' usage. We won't oversell her dice rolling ability to you, but Lily's seven (!!!) 45% Gauntlets give her more chances to perform than most edge case Gauntleteers. 

Beyond that she's pure, distilled Collection goodness. Lily has the potential to be one of the most valuable Collection crew in the game moving forward, given her three stat-Boosting slots now, a spot in a fun Vanity, and Traits for two more viable ones. We wonâ€™t undersell her Node-cracking abilities for Fleet Boss Battles either!
