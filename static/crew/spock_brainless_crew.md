Brain, Brain! What is Brain! Hailing from potentially the worst episode of Star Trek ever here is a card who, for once, matches his diminished form. His ENG stats are not the worst, but they are hardly a desirable feature. Although he can fulfill two days worth of cadet missions there are better engineers that are more readily available. Lt. Commander Data for instance is an older card however far superior in every way and the Vulcan collection is so abundant that it's a worthless metric nowadays. (Currently Not Available In The Portal)
