In this book of truth we only display acts of absolute candor, therefore I am honor bound by service in the Qowat Milat to tell you...this card kinda sucks. The amount of Picard currency we now have could upset the economy of a developing nation; oh the irony if we never see another Picard event. However if we take away the shiny veneer of Patrick’s fantastic jacket, there isn’t much substance behind the man. 
There's not much call for yet another DIP/SEC super rare crew to bolster a growing roster. Even though his proficiencies are higher than the average Romulan, it’s not enough to get him anywhere near any must-have lists for gauntlet or voyages. His two redeeming features are an easy notch on the diplomat board and playing hot potato on a Faction ranking.
