Crusher's skill set has been carrying her for a long time, but the numbers simply aren't there anymore. Yawn-inducing voyage, base, and event rankings with gauntlet pairs that require hefty amounts of crit to function. The afforementioned skill set and slim gauntlet work make her something of a boon to newer players, but there's no light at the end of the tunnel; her ceiling has a hard cap of MED/CMD voyages and one-a-year Faction work.
