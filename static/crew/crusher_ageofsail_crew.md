Crusher's Skill set carried her for a long time, but the numbers simply aren't there anymore. Yawn-inducing Voyage, Base, and Event rankings with Gauntlet pairs that require hefty amounts of Crit to function outside of the early game do not make this variant appetizing.

Still, the MED/CMD wasteland should at least allow Gates to net you a few wins there if you’re at the helm of a young roster and at least her Collection value is realized and not theoretical. If you’re a big Vanity Collection fiend, keep in mind that this crew cannot be isolated to a 100% chance in Crew Retrieval so you may want to take her now if there are no strong options flanking her.
