“Worst Dad” Leucon once sat smugly among the top Voyagers, but thankfully Power Creep has compressed him into the soil and has made him an occasional Voyager at best. His Collection ceiling also is not far from the ground level; two as it stands, but his other Traits are either pretty esoteric or too large to get much consideration from WRG (but we’ve been wrong before).
