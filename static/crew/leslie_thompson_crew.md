It’s hard to picture a more “Super Rare” crew if you tried. Fittingly, Leslie could have excelled in the early Timelines era thanks to a SEC/SCI skill set which used to lack options and power which could mix with partially fused Legendary crew on voyages and shuttles. In today’s climate, however, her utility is as unremarkable as her overall panache.

While a card with these stats can buoy early game rosters if collected fully fused from events, Leslie being stuck in a weekday pack and lacking long term value makes her a non-starter at every level of play.
