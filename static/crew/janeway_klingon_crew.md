Janeway’s going to have to pull a Worf soon - “I have nothing…but my honor” - as she loses daily use footholds over time. It’s hard to believe that her Voyage power used to play thanks to an underrepresented SEC/SCI stack, but those days are behind her. And while she filled an Ardra-lite role on Ships if you wanted to freeze the prototype, a flat 10,000 Crit Bonus isn’t quite as punchy as other options.

There’s still value in easy SEC seating for an Event-heavy character and she has enough Traits to keep her afloat there and in the Collections tab. All things considered, she remains above average value for a crew from 2017, but will need to pick her spots to make a splash these days.
