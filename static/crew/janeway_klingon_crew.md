SEC/SCI has been historically hard to come by for voyages, meaning that despite a sinking voyage rank, Janeway is not yet a lost cause. But it's her prodigious event potential that we're after. A capable SEC base has had dozens of opportunties to shine on the weekend and though her event clip may slow with a few mega events in the rear view mirror, the name Janeway isn't going anywhere and she still carres a bit of juice in her traits. Likely to make event shuttles from star one, Klingon Janeway is a fine mid-level name to come across in a behold.
