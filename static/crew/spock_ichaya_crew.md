All eyes are on SpockBearPig's mouth-watering skill set and thus his Voyage work, but it's probably better to think of Spock and Itchy as an Event and Collection piece

With poor Voyage power that is what youâ€™d expect from a two year old crew, even their vaunted skill order and accompanying traits to do not buoy their effectiveness. Even though CMD/MED is still scarce they likely will not even find minimal work on most rosters.

They still have the top Spock MED and a strong Spock CMD base (not easy to do for a man with as many faces as Spock), but their real lasting value is in their cornucopia of traits which have yielded a veritable feast of Collections - seven! Feel no shame in taking this Voyage dud, for they are a Collection superstar!
