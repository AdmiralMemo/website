There's a lot to like about Seven, despite some deceptively low Bases. Eligible for two of the three weekday Cadet Challenges, her highlight comes on Tuesdays (Harriman.mp4), where she can hold down two Nodes on Mission Five, thanks to capable rolls from two different Skills in combination with matching Traits.

Beyond Cadets, where she can Crit any SCI Node she's eligible for, Seven is something of a gatekeeper to the Borg Collection. With Hugh the only other low-Rarity option and Seven costing just half as much to Fully Equip, sheâ€™ll give you your first notch on that Collection and a global Stat boost.
