A 2017 2-skiller - most players should know right off the bat what to expect from that. A fine pinch hitter on Shuttles, Odo's plate is rarely crowded, but owns a modest Event tally and might even catch a curveball in the form of a Constable one-off Event.

Already with a trio of leadoff Collections, Odo could improve that count and sit juuuuust a bit outside the kind of tempting choices that save you from an ugly Behold. It's easy to balk at an older 2-Skill crew, but Ump offers enough to avoid a total strike out.
