Fleet Boss Battles have staked claim to a lot of shipboard value these days, so you’re probably wondering if RPC is still worth the effort. Since you’re all going to die anyways, why not tell you? The answer is…

Well yes, but actually no. With additional FBB bosses shelved for the foreseeable future, RPC’s activation limit of two relegates him to skirmish and arena competitor. That’s still a valuable niche to hold the fort in and he’s as fine as almost any immediate damage option, just don’t expect him to ride your Artifacts for three minute Fleet Boss Battles.

The future monster hunter (to know him will be to love him) also has a strong collection ceiling, potentially seeing eight stat-boosters when it’s all said and done. Factoring in some sporadic Faction Action which complements his good-for-shuttles skill set, RPC is still a reasonable behold or retrieval option for new and old accounts alike, even if he’s no longer a must-have on ships.
