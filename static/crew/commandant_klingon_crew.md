Another CMD/DIP/SEC *yawn* ... but hold on a minute! His ship ability is a straight copy/paste from the vaunted Captain Killy which gives this crew incredible potential impact, even from one star. With most crew, we quibble over ranks and small percentage points, but Skirmishes are the place where your gameplay can be most affected. If adding RPC to your ranks would shave seconds off your ship battles (times the thousand(s) of runs required), then do what you can to at least acquire a copy.

If you're already stocked with premier shipboard options, the Commandant is still fine crew. Despite owning a skill set you're already overrun with, he also supplies satisfactory voyage numbers with some juicy antimatter traits and a 1200+ CMD base will sit near the top of most of his trait lists. Having qualified for two previous megas, his event count may be a bit inflated, but he'll still have the occasional chance to pick up weekend bonuses.
