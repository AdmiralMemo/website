Q2’s most notable contribution to the game is that he is Corbin Benson. Right behind that is deceptive Gauntlet power not quite good enough to bring him on your team unless he’s amongst the first Legendaries you luck into. He’s got three Traits, one which has already found his racial Collection, and one more that is viable to find one later, and three is also the number of seconds you’ll spend looking at his crew page before deciding to pick someone else in a Behold.
