Missed potential, thy name is Dreamwalker. A sublimely unique skill order among Legendary crew is paired with a mouth-watering Trait line-up for a MED voyager (100+ Duelist and Hunters with almost no MED representation) to give Chakotay the potential to blow the roof off of Voyages as a premier option who fits into untapped niches. And then J.J. Abrams takes over the script and lens flares Dreamwalker into the worst 3-skill voyage rank debut in the history of the game. 

Lacking the event pedigree of other series' First Officers, Chakotay, who is also Collection-less, was perfectly set up to fulfill his incredible Voyage promise instead. Alas, it was not meant to be and this underbaked cookie comes out of the oven not ready to help anyone do much of anything. 

The only significant MED option for Chakotay events will lock Dreamwalker into Shuttle work for about four days out of every four thousand, but until those planets align, you'll just be crossing your fingers for Maquis or another of his non-standard Traits to hit on the Collection wheel of fortune.
