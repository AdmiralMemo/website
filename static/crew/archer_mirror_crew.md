Over thirty events for an Archer?! What is this, the Mirror Universe? Actually, yea.

Even though some might consider certain Traits 'tapped' for future Mega Events, M’Archer does have a few viable Traits he can call on down the line to “highlight” a pair of flaccid Bases for your requisition Shuttles. He’s not close to daily use and may not even merit a thaw for many users, but minor Collection value gives him universal appeal and CMD/SEC dominates Event seating.
