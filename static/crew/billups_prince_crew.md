Prince Andarithio Quintanius Billups was raised amidst the champagne wishes and caviar dream of Hysperia’s Ren Faire-like world, only to flee his birthright and join Starfleet rather than have sex and become king. (I bet you didn’t know that was his full name. I also bet you believed me just now. I made it up. Just kidding, I only made one of those names up.)

Like a virgin, playing Timelines for the very first time, Billups eases into things as a Super Rare. If you, dear reader, are a Timelines virgin yourself, you’re in luck! Andy may be new at this, but he’s actually a natural born Voyage stud! Between that and Shuttles, you’ll find that what he lacks in experience, he makes up for in the size of his…Base stats. The novelty will certainly wear off in time, once you find yourself in the company of, um, more “worldly” men and women, but know that he will treat you right from the moment he joins your roster.
