Rich Corinthian traits highlighted by impeccable stitching. Flint is the renaissance man of every era and says "Look, son" to Douwds and Organians on the regular.

So of course he's a Collection sleeping giant and one of the best possible speculative grabs in that area. Laz should be usable for Event Shuttles when his banquet of Traits pop a bonus, though that's more of the icing on the cake alongside Baby's First Gauntlet-type proficiencies. If you care for card art, flavor text, or Traits, Flint is the full piquancy package and worth a gander even if his power won't blow you away.
