Scotty debuted as a 'daily use' Voyage and Shuttle crew, but now he's just...a crew. ENG seating being as scarce as it is handicaps his best statistical offering; his Base. He'll still ride some Event Shuttles when given the opportunity, but that's unfortunately quite rare, even if his Event clip is better than it once was.

His spot in the Jury Rigger Collection saves his bacon from the airlock and gives at least veteran rosters a reason to grab a copy here and there, but those of you looking for consistent use from your Super Rares can give him a hard pass and swing back around to fuse him at a later date.
