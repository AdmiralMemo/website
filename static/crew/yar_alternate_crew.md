Like her character, Tasha's Event appearances dropped off after STT's season one, but she's still 'Bridge Crew' with a few Event-able Traits to help grant her some weekend work. Her other non-Collection perk is an Instant Damage Ship Ability (300%), useful for new players. Check for Sela’s mommy to max out at three Collections long after she was forgotten by the alternate Enterprise’s crew.
