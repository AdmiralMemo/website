It seems just about time for the Saboteur (of wooden shoe origin - thanks, Valeris) Collection to hit, which would make Admiral Arrestthosemen tangentially relevant for a period. Until that happens, relevant he is not and not worth the Behold equity. If youâ€™re a fan of Brock Peters, try out the much more elite Joseph Sisko crew instead.
