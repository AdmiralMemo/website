Geordi probably went a little too far with his home theater system (featuring Boseâ„¢ surround sound), but at least he doesn't have to get up for bathroom breaks.

It's rare to see crew without a Collection these days (though that's sure to change by the time you're reading this) but with a few viable Traits, an Ardra-esque Ship Ability, and moderate Event work, he still clocks in as a mid-level crew with options for usability.
