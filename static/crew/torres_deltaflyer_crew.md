The event rate is likely to slow for this particular Torres variant due to a few previously tapped traits, but with THREE variant-best bases, she can pick her seat to any Torres event down the line. More frequently useful to most players is voyage work that compares almost identically to former mega Determined Janeway - someone who might be on your voyage right now. There aren't too many corners to dive into here and her usage is a bit narrower for established rosters, but she's a strong event/voyage combo to behold and easily the best legendary Torres.
