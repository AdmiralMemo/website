Oof, those are some 2016, launch day-type numbers on Zareh. He doesn't fit the base/event/voyage mold of so many crew, but that doesn't mean he's a total dud.

Niche usefulness is available at one star for younger rosters thanks to a nice trait set and proficiency pair which combine for a crit-boosted top five CMD/SEC roll in three different gauntlets. Those traits are immaterial for event potential with bases this bad, but you already knew that.

The other area of interest is Zareh's shipboard +9 attack boost. The handicap, initialization, and duration times are all a hair off from where you'd like them to be, but a new roster can't be picky. His attack boost, when fused, may anchor some arena and skirmish scuffles through your account's early months.
