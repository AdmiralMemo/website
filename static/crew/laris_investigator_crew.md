A fascinating character, gorgeous skill set, triplet of Collections...what could be better? Well, a competent power level for starters. Unfortunately WRG turned the horsepower dial way down on Laris, not only bumming out more than a few Legendary truthers, but also granting her the sad combination of bad base and Voyage stats. One can only hope that this is a Jett Reno/Medic Jett Reno situation and that the big boom is coming. Until then, you have Collection fodder, two Traits that could still bear fruit, some rare Romulan SCI, and a could-have-been.
