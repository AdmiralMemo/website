The best case scenario for any CMD/DIP/SEC crew or thin trait set. Georgiou has probably outlived her voyage usefulness in most situations thanks to a particularly poor skill set, but with double collections and a monstrous event clip (and event future), she'll do most of her heavy lifting post-cryo.
