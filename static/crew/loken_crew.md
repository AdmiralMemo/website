Oh my God, Loken has ENG/MED! Get him and Cite him immediately! … is that we would say if his Voyage power hadn’t atrophied to the point where it’s almost irrelevant. 

Little more than the sum of his Trait list at this point, the best Kraylor in the game is a worthwhile-ish long-term investment if you find his stars in otherwise uninspiring Beholds, since he’ll likely top out at four Collections when all is said and done.
