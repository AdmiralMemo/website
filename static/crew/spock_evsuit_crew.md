You know, looking back, it's a good thing that Leonard Nimoy hit on the idea of the Vulcan nerve pinch as a non-lethal, non-violent method of incapacitating people, because good lord does Spock do a lot of them to fellow Starfleet personnel before doing something very stupid and illogical, like he does before donning this rather bulky looking EV Suit. Perhaps that's why his SEC tertiary is more like a side dish than the main course people might have been hoping for, making him seem more indistinct than he actually is.

On certain other crew, or without the collections, Spock's humdrum stat ranks might not seem like worthy investments. But he *does* have those other attributes and is a good all-'rounder, promising perennial use as a top event name, even when he voyage power fades.

Spock, much like Data, accrues very similar, very hard to separate variants. But unlike Data, Spock's event clip is as constant as the Northern star (oops, wrong TOS movie), and even his worst variants will see play - and this is far from his worst variant. As mega crew go, there may be a few more potent or flashy names, but reliability is where this Spock is going to shine. If you turned down the brusque, premium taste of the Science Officer Spock campaign, this decidedly more classic vintage of the same wine offers much the same power for an easier to swallow price of just a few chronitons.
