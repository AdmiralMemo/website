You know, looking back, it's a good thing that Leonard Nimoy hit on the idea of the Vulcan nerve pinch as a non-lethal, non-violent method of incapacitating people, because good lord does Spock do a lot of them to fellow Starfleet personnel before doing something very stupid and illogical, like he does before donning this rather bulky looking EV Suit. Perhaps that's why his SEC tertiary is more like a side dish than the main course people might have been hoping for, sitting #4 among variants, making him seem more indistinct than he actually is.

This is the kind of crew that people are going to look back on in a year, and realise they've been running non-stop voyages for them despite having initially dismissed them because they were 'just another common skill pairing.' And yes, SCI/ENG is that - but at any kind of power, and teamed with this kind of longstanding event value, not to mention an easy addition to your Vulcan collection? When you look at the numbers and who can actually outperform this particular Spock, the field is more barren than you might think.

Spock, much like Data, accrues very similar, very hard to separate variants. But unlike Data, Spock's event clip is as constant as the Northern star (oops, wrong TOS movie), and even his worst variants will see play - and this is far from his worst variant. As mega crew go, there may be a few more potent, a few more flashy, but reliability is where this Spock is going to shine. And, as an added bonus, if you shy away from the brusque, premium taste of the campaign 5* Science Officer Spock, this decidedly more classic vintage of the same wine offers much the same power for a much less dear price of just a few Chronitons.
