This fantastically loathsome villain certainly deserved more power for his part in one of everybody's favorite Trek two-parters. He's among the worst options for Instant Damage on Ships (but you HAVE heard of him) which leaves just the Gauntlet as his only real chance for work. He parlays twenty elevated Crit Gauntlets into a single chance at use. Hmm, well I guess he USED to be good.

If you select him for his deliciously hateable role in torturing Jean-Luc, then take solace in the fact that Madred was one of the early winners of the Collection era and his value there keeps him drifting above handfuls of other dud Legendary crew.
