A former “meh” power Giveaway crew, Sarek has somewhat been the gift that keeps on giving. He probably hasn’t sniffed much daily use for anyone in years, but the Trait Era™ has been good to him, providing prodigious Event and Collection value that should abide for a while longer.

Still afloat on the weekends despite the tapering off of his show Mega Events, Sarek’s Traits and even his variants should be good for at least a couple Events yearly with the odd Mega Event power spike from time to time. And his sextet of Collections could potentially add a trio more depending on what Traits get the love from WRG.

With some very usable Instant Damage without a Trigger available at one star, Sarek offers value via some non-traditional avenues, even if he’s best enjoyed by late game, established rosters.
