This was a crew that sort of had to be good, given the iconic nature of the scene and the climax of Sito's character arc. Worf's protege has a nice bevy of Traits that could almost all hit both a Collection, Mega Events, or, as is increasingly the vogue, both. 

It's also not as if she isn't eminently usable elsewhere, sporting a SEC Base that would make older, more reputable Legendary crew seem inadequate and a Voyage score that is still viable on rosters that have yet to make the jump to all Legendary crew. All in all, a solid crew that will more than likely only improve with age - and the Cobra Kai bridge crew photos simply won't be complete without her.
