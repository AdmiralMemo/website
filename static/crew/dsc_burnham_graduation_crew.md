Graduation Burnham, an example of applying “cultural” racial Traits to crew, has the Vulcan Trait to buoy her already impressive Event resume. A solid SCI Base for variant and Trait-based Events alike, Vulcan Haircut Michael is likely to have a four Collection ceiling, so freely choose her from your Super Rare Beholds without prejudice.
