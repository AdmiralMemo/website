Brother Rom has most of what you want from a Super Rare crew: occasional Events, a decent Base for those events, and a handful of Collections. This variant comes packed with a strong DIP Base for Event Shuttles, three Collections and room for one more if Bartender even hits, and a really really deep collar on his jacket.
