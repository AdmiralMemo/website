This Reed’s card daily use prospects are more embarrassing than finding out someone likes pineapple (but is allergic to something the pineapple *contains*). And the laughably low SEC Base for a Tactical Officer that got duped by his penis is certainly thematic, but doesn’t much help his poor overall power level.

As with most crew of a certain age, Reed is a string of Traits for Collections and Events. Despite poor Bases, CMD and DIP seating is plentiful and he may merit the thaw for certain rosters, but this is more of a bland, perfunctory crew to build passively from Voyages and otherwise bad Beholds.
