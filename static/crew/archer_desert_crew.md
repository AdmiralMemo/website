We'd like to work in a "carrying the mail" joke here, but the truth is UPS Archer is unlikely to deliver. 

Surprisingly, one of this Archer's relative strengths is Events. Always the black sheep Trek Captain, he's not often a featured name, but at least has rebounded from a no-show first few years of Timelines to earn a couple bonuses each year with Traits to puff up those numbers. 

Naturally, Collections are the hot topic around the teapot and Desert has perhaps the most effective Traits of his Legendary cousins. A Collection count that could improve (from three to four, but still thatâ€™s an improvement by definition), niche Arena usability, and occasional weekend relevance makes choosing Archer in a Behold a reasonable outcome, especially against poor or irrelevant options.
