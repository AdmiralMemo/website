One of the “Bound” Girls, not to be confused with Bond Girls, D’Nesh took a long time to get going in the game, but her Trait list is finally paying off. She’s rode the elevator almost halfway to the penthouse of her seven Collection ceiling, and she’s starting to parlay those Traits into more-than-occasional weekend work, where her DIP base will shine. She’s a long term investment, but one that is starting to pay off.
