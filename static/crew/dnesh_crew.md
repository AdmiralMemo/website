Is there any green girl that Kirk *won't* sleep with? We might just find out as the icy depths of tier 10 welcomes its third Orion slave. Even 'Bound' contemporary crew Maras has a leg up on D'Nesh thanks to a far more common shuttle skill pairing, leaving some thin trait value as her best asset. 

Unless you're that dweeb Commander Kelby, don't look directly into this sorcerer's eyes and save your resources for someone with better power or utility. You won't have to look far.
