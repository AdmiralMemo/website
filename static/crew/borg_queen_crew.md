Today's obligatory Mega reputation reset reminder (what a mouthful) has been brought to you by the Big Book. You might not know the Queen is almost three years old, thanks to the wonderful flesh-stretching sessions afforded her, but a sub-20 base and 100-ish voyage rank is something to keep in mind amidst the many 'rock-solid' testimonials praising this crew.

That being said, she's still worthwhile, despite her age. Somehow the seeming one-off character has collected a handful of mega events with room for more, especially if ST:Picard buoys Borg again. And on voyages, she should make plenty of runs thanks to the rarest non-MED skill set in the game. It may not be 2017 anymore, but Alice is still turning back the clock.
