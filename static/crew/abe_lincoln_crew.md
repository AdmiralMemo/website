Like many other crew, Honest Abe is at the mercy of trait megas to be of any use on the weekends, which has yet to happen for him. With putrid voyage power beside, Lincoln is a bottom-barrel behold option who will team up a borderline top 20 gauntlet pair with a seldom seen 45% crit trait set for infrequent gauntlet relevance. Don't chase pie in the sky double collections with this crew who doesn't deserve stars two through five.
