This is what happens to promising young careers after meeting up with Wesley Crusher. Lefler is, in essence, a series of Traits at this point in time. And although all seven of hers show up as Antimatter traits, only four have the option to flourish as Event and Collection markers.

Already a multi-Collection piece, late game players will happily snag copies through Beholds and Voyages when possible, but her ceiling in that area isn't massive. Between relatively large bonus pools for possible Events and a primary Skill that isn't always favored for Shuttle seating, you're not likely to get much "real" use out of Lefler.
