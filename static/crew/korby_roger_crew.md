Pinocchio may have Vreenak triggered, but the not-quite-real boy at least has some very real usability in game. Respectable voyage metrics and an uncommon skill set frame Roger Rabbit's most likely contribution to your roster, while a collection spot and some intriguing traits set him apart from near clone and recent event also-ran Dr. Edward La Forge.

The value of his SCI base will vary depending on the sort of roster who wants to immortalize him, but it does rank favorably against the current options for possible trait event bonuses such as Android, Physician, and Undercover Operative.

With uncertain long term relevance and day one voyage prowess, Korby is best treated as a short-term fusion project, if indeed you do want to finish the mechanical man to boost voyages or your whimsy collection.
