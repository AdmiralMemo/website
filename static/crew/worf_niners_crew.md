You know what you should do if you can identify the employee who keeps giving Worf generic and bad CMD/DIP/SEC variants? Find him and kill him! No, but in all seriousness, this is a rather poor variant whose best claim used to be being one of the better Worf SEC bases - not so much anymore, with the advent of his more virile brother, Age of Sail Worf. He’ll make shuttles when his event number is called, but he’s not exactly daily use crew, and, in the end, you’re really just taking him for the vanity.
