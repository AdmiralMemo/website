An Attack Boost on Ships at four seconds never gets a mention thanks to its Accuracy handicap, leaving a reasonable SEC Base and smattering of Traits as the talking points.

A few of the Traits so far have borne Collection fruit including her hidden show tag, and look for a ceiling of five to be hit before long. If the Plakson faithful want her, youâ€™re taking Tarah on the back of a gun and a prayer for future Events to justify thawing her.
