Wrathful Khan, as a launch card, has failed to hold relevance when it comes to his Bases or Voyage power, but DB saw fit to give him a Trait list fit for a man who once ruled much of the known world!

Four collections with viable Traits for at least two more give him enduring value towards those global Stat boosts we all want, plus he is among the best Fleet Boss Battles Node solvers in the game. Those myriad Traits will also help when his number is called for weekend Faction Events, but his low Bases may relegate him to rented Shuttles.
