A "use" crew, rather than an investment. The #1 super rare SEC proficiency gives her gauntlet work right from 1/4 and her arena attack is quick enough to be useful, even if it's painfully short. Despite sporting the Discovery tag, she's not a recommending thaw between bad bases and a plethora of other options. Ultimately replaceable, she makes the best target on brand new rosters for whom gauntlet work can be difficult to find.
