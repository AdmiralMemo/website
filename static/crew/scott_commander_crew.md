A pretty lackluster engineer. He sports a significant ENG base with a rather uncommon CMD modifier, but not at the strength that would make him useful for many voyages. His Innovator collection bonus means you probably wonâ€™t kick him out straight away but there are plenty of engineers with better stats that can put in more daily work.
