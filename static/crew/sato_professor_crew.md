For years, Sato stood alone at the top of the DIP Base ranks and rode many a Shuttle. While she has since been pipped by Honor Hall release Technician Uhura and Gauntlet Exclusive Mirror Mariner, this does not take away from her long reign, and she will still find herself on Shuttles if you haven’t found the time or wherewithal or good fortune to either buy Uhura or get yourself a Fully Fused Mariner.

Sato’s value is almost solely in that DIP Base, but over time her Traits have borne some Collection fruit; three as it stands, with one more viable one to possibly give her a quartet.
