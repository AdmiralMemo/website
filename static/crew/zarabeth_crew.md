Hailing from a personal favorite episode that saw Mr. Atoz push the Pram-a-lot, Zarabeth’s art holds up its end of the bargain, but the raw Stats don’t. A quick glance will let you know that outside of some early game Evasion on Ships, there’s really nothing here outside of what Traits can provide.

That being said, Zarabeth has a healthy Collection profile and has mustered a respectable Event history during the “Trait Mega Event Era” and looks to continue that going forward. She’s merely a bit player and not a wagon to hitch your early game roster to, but still a Super Rare option that established players should be happy to welcome aboard.
