Hailing from a good episode and having good art do not a good card make, and unfortunately Zarabeth doesn't bring much else to the table. A two-skiller with neither base debuting in the top 30 for Super Rares is an inauspicious beginning. Her traits are decent, but most of the eventable ones have already been tapped for megas and one-off events.

Looking further, we see no collections, and a ship ability (EV) that's just "okay." She'll be fine to use in her debut skirmish, but after that it's freeze and forget. Her only long term value beyond +1 immo is the possibility of making a great bridge crew lineup if we ever get a card for Mr. Atoz in the game.
