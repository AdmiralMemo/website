No, he doesn’t have a mine poking through his leg, but he’s still a hero. At least insofar as saving Travis counts as heroism. 

Reed gets no love from WRG on the weekend (more like indifference) but with a smattering of Traits and healthy Bases, you may be pleasantly surprised by his occasional opportunity at bonus work. Throw in some above average Collection value and Reed is a Jack of most trades and a plenty serviceable option for long-suffering Reed fans.
