The second-ever Uber Campaign Legendary, Rillak was a pivot from Second Chance Laris (Gauntlet and Collections) to just Collections. The most boring Skill set known to man (or the Bajorans or Cardassians for that matter), without the power to make up for it, makes Rillak solely a series of Traits and their associated Collections and Events.

However, that Trait list is STACKED. A sextet of Collections and perhaps one more viable Trait makes her one of the top Collection crew in the game (albeit without much further room to grow), and that common Skill set we just panned gives her Shuttle seating chances in all those Trait-based Events she’ll qualify for. If you’re in the part of the game where stacking Collection bonuses are key, grab her from Legendary Beholds and add her to Crew Retrieval lists without shame.
