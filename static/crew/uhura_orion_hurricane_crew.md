An Animated version of Celia Rose Gooding’s portrayal of Uhura, this Orion Hurricane variant is, as it stands, far and away the best crew released from this scene. Appropriately, she comes gated by Dilithium in a Tuesday Time Portal Pack (don’t pull six packs, kids!). A top-flight crew for your Voyages, while unfortunately shacked by her tired DIP/SCI/CMD, OHUra has many positive attributes to pick from if you are wont to splash around in the whale pool. A quintet of Collections on debut makes her very attractive in that arena given the recent massive Collection expansion, and Uhura is a bankable Event name, even though in recent years she has gotten more love from her Traits than her character variants (only a single variant Event since 2022). A Charge-based Ship Ability is an oddity, but even if you just let Auto fly your Ships you’ll still get +15000 to Crit Bonus at 8s, with a sizable Accuracy Boost, if that is your bag. In the long run she’ll be a solid Event/Collection crew piece, but with that Skill Set she’ll age quickly on your Voyages.
