"Will, I sense that we should have retracted the plank, not removed the plank."

Any roster still using super rares on voyages should welcome aboard MED at every opportunity and AoS Troi, the top MED/dip voyager, certainly qualifies. The raw numbers there are worthwhile, but it's in combination with the dearth of that skill set where they shine.

If voyaging the high seas aboard the HMS Enterprise doesn't suit your fancy, Troi has a few other noteworthy offerings. Her MED base won't find much work without a bonus, but edges out Assimilated Troi for tops among super rare variants and comes with a vanity collection spot and (brief) +9 attack boost on ships. Troi is a fantastic get for early-mid game rosters with a somewhat fluffier impact for long time players.
