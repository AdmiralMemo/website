"Will, I sense that we should have retracted the plank, not removed the plank."

Any crew who relies on their voyage ability below the Legendary rarity level absolutely needs ancillary benefits to have any staying power. While Marina’s MED-led skill set gives her a chance to still contribute there on new rosters, it’s really the rest of the card that will decide if she’s earned her crew slot on your team.

If voyaging the high seas aboard the HMS Enterprise doesn't work out, this variant’s MED base is tops among Super Rare Troi options, her +9 attack boost on ships is relevant for newcomers, and there’s a reasonable Collection ceiling for her to hit if WRG decides to expand on the Betazoid love to show favour to Troi-heavy traits like Empath and Counselor.
