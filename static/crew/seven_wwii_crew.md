A poor man's Gangster Spock, this Seven variant is similarly pointed toward Gauntlet, but with less meat on the bone in the Trait and Event departments.

Owner of a fairly nice Skill set for dice rolling, SEC/SCI does have a good amount of competition, but SEC/ENG less so and that will be her chance at 2-for-1ing bigger bodies, such as The Caretaker. Solid overall Proficiency and an extreme number of elevated Crit sets make this an ideal stepping stone Gauntlet option for newer rosters to get their foot in the door of a competitive area of play. Unfortunately, established rosters won't find much use for her here.

Almost a lateral step left brings us to the Collection tab where Mademoiselle is in multiple Collections and should pick up a few more. Again, not at the top of her field in this area, but with tangible benefits, this time for more veteran users.

Shaky Event value is mostly a product of her poor Bases thanks to the heavier Proficiency allocation, but we again see a reasonable value profile in the form of a consistent, if modest, Event history. Mademoiselle generally looks better on paper than she does in real world usage due to a lack of power, but undoubtedly offers at least some amount of value to players at every stage of play and is far from dud territory.
