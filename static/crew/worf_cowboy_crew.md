Sheriff Worf was an early top Collection name for Super Rares, but even though he’s no longer at the top of the list, he’s still a strong crew in that regard with a quartet, and two possible more inclusions.

Worf is also a name of note, nipping on Jim Kirk's heels for the most Event bonuses in the history of the game. His variants have picked up a bonus in each of the game's seven calendar years and the constable even has a big bonus Feature himself, not to mention a comfortable lead for Worf's best CMD at the Super Rare level. In the two classic long term areas of value for Super Rare crew, Collections and Event work, Worf is a no-brainer.
