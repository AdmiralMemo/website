Get your headsets on and strap in for the #1 3* ENG crew in the game. Only Smiley O’Brian beats her for base stats but the rest she is queen of the mechanics. If you have completed your cadets and the useful ENG nodes she still makes the cut due to her 800+ ENG max stat. But the only part that lets her down is her poor CMD stat which essentially makes her a one skilled crew member, so voyaging is not her best but she’ll add to the many Innovator crewmembers in expanding that collection. Lefler has a fun little easter egg too if you can find it.
