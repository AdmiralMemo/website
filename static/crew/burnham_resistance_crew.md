One of two bookend CMD/DIP/SEC giveaway crew in 2021, on the heels of another CDS Burnham variant, on the heels of back to back CDS Mega Event Recurring Legendary crew, sandwiched between CDS Event crew... Suffice it to say, if you stay current with Timelines, Resistance Burnham is a crew you don't need.

That being said, Burnham is eternal and the same boring Skill set that smothers the Voyage ranks never hurts for Shuttle seating. As the top Burnham DIP option she will be useful, if replaceable, in that area. With her Traits not giving her much event help and capping her potential Collection value, Resistance is primarily an Event piece that doesn't cover new ground.
