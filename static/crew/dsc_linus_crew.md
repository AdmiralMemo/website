Joke crew generally don't fare well in game (Reginod #1 engineer, c'mon baby!), and this one is no exception. Lacking even his safety blanket, Linus has nothing noteworthy to offer rosters.

His debut voyage numbers paired with the second most common skill set limit him to early-game contributor, while his trait set is unbuttered toast and his niche uses combine to produce that sound that plays when you guess wrong on a game show.

Presuming Discovery events were to resume after their hiatus of over a year, you can probably squeeze him onto a requisition shuttle if you don't have too many of the seventeen other better Disco SCI bases floating around your roster.
