It's always exciting to witness the birth of a new trope. Geordi earnestly saying there's a problem on the Holodeck in The Big Goodbye... Janeway fresh off the boat from Kalto province wearing a shirt that says 'Screw the Temporal Prime Directive'... So what better way to celebrate the on-ramp of the road to Captain Braxton's eventual therapy trip than the addition of the long-requested 'Stripy Shirt Janeway'?

She hits the right notes for your typical Base/Event crew, starting with variant events second to n(one). Lacking some shiny variant-best honorific, she simply will hold down the abundant SCI and DIP seats for Janeway events with aplomb. You might miss the gaudy Event count of a Discovery or Trait-rich crew, but her sterling Faction rate has provided similar value to those options thus far. 

Aged out of Voyages for all but the newest players, Candy CornWay can still provide lasting value for all given a trio of current Collections and an upper ceiling of four.
