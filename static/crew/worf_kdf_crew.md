Civil Warf is a theoretical SEC Base for Worf/Klingon Faction Events, but his blunted Bases will cease to merit the thaw at some point in your Timelines journey. The same can be said for a 12 second 200% Instant Damage Ship Ability which is nice for new players, but too slow to maintain a spot in your Skirmish or Arena lineup.

His most enduring attribute is likely to be whatever Collection value materializes from his handful of viable Traits. A few points of interest here, but most will evaporate as your roster grows in power.
