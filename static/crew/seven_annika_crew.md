Annika was, at launch, one of just two Voyage-capable Seven (of Nine) variants. With time having ravaged her metrics since then, the former MMMBop sensation is on thin ice elsewhere.

Events are something of a (lumpy) cushion for her, although between lacking in Traits and with more than one dud year on her résumé, she's more in the pleasant surprise territory of weekend Shuttle names. Still a zero on the Collections tab, at least she has a low ceiling of two.
