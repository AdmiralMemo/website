Waking up with a fat stack of past event bonuses is pretty nice for someone with so little screen time. Since time of release, no less than six better SEC bases have bludgeoned her value in the Disco pool to death, and she sits at a measly #3 for the Mirror Universe. The fact that she's fairly dependent on those bonuses for relevance should therefore be considered a warning. If there's a discernible end to the torrent of all-Disco events, then Landry and several other crew will plummet right into the garbage, which isn't to say they're great now, but they can always get worse. Until that happens, she sits on a dynamite keg of event potential. She's a fine Faction piece acquisition, but a very risky investment.
