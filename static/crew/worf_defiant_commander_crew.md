Gross stats, though very new players might get a win out of him in the gauntlet. Even if Worf/Klingon events are frequent enough, his bases won't win you any weeks. Great crit values in the arena are undercut by a slower activation time and evasion handicap - there are better options available. His equip list is relatively light on Klingon/KCA faction items if you want to level him the week before his event.
