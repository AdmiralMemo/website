Worf's brand name will win him some fans, but unless he expands on his three previous big-bonus features, a pair of dishonorable Vases aren't going to win him much Faction Event seating in the future. A thin Trait list should see him as a multi-Collection piece before too long, which is perhaps when you should start to consider a Behold investment.
