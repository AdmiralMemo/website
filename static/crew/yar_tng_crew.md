Pure SEC baby. Which is fine in the early-early game but moving out of the first Missions you will find her uses limited. Her Ship Ability will give you a taste of what late-game Arena use is like but once you get better Rare cards in your manifest she will probably be one of the first to leave. Long after youâ€™ve used her for the last time she may keep paying off with up to one more Collection.
