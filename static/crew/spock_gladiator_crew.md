The renaissance man is at it again, this time putting Gangster's peashooter to shame. Double digit traits have created double, double digit event chances and give him excellent utility for both voyage antimatter and future event bonuses. His base SEC is leagues ahead of the next best Spock option who happens to be someone players rarely immortalize; one-star wonder Gangster Spock. He can handle his variants' competition with a single star and in many cases will be the easy choice over super rares to win your favor for shuttle seating. In combination with prodigious weekend work, his gun (sword, I guess) will be called upon fairly frequently.

Gladiator is just as brawny on voyages where a still-good raw total meets an option deficient skill set to make him the #2 SEC/SCI voyager behind the much ballyhooed Gary Seven, and while he may have just dropped out of the top 100, the statistical difference between him and the next best option is nothing to be sniffed at, so rest assured that his voyage work is safe for quite a while. Piddly proficiency numbers and middling arena work are available for the glass-half-empty crowd to critique, but his owners will be too busy using him regularly to care.
