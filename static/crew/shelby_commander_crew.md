Well, I kept lookin' at that picture, and it kept buggin' me, you know? Why was she trying to write "help" in the dirt and then it came to me! She was trying to write the killer's name, "Shelby." Only she must've died before she finished the "b" and, and somebody must've kicked dirt over the "s."

Someone should have scratched "Help" into the dirt for Riker2.0, 'cause Shelbs needs it. Shuttle friendly Bases would be worth thawing if/when her Traits catch an Event and surely the Great Wheel of Collections will favor her a few times in the future. Until then, avoid her like you're a scout ship scuttling through Wolf 359.
