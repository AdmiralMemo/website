He no longer owns a sterling #1 gauntlet pair, but thanks to his availability as a mega event crew, the Walls of Surak (my band's name) still echo in the gauntlet. Besides being unavoidable there, a healthy SCI base and even better voyage total have him contributing from multiple angles. With Vulcan unlikely to be his last trait mega, it would be only logical to behold him if you have the chance. He's one of the best daily use crew in the game and excellent right from star one.
