Rom's a sum-of-his-parts crew. 'Merely' a two-skiller, his value lies in an all-star lineup of traits and collections. On the event front, Niners Rom is a crew with a believable path to increasing his bonus rate in the future. A handful of his many viable traits have supplemented his event tally to date and only once through mega events, leaving a realistic chance for multi-week thawpertunities.

More tangible is his heady collection power. With a likely path to double digit collections, there’s no reason rosters at any stage of play should be passing on him. Rom doesn’t offer much daily use past the early game, but the value is there in other areas of this card.
