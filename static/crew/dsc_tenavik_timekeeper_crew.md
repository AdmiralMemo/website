Sidling up to the renowned First Officer Burnham, this Timelord siphons her usefulness and reputation as if he were living on Planet M-113. A very good imitation, Tenavik offers fulsome base and voyage power in amounts very similar to Burnham, trading in her variant event history for some very spotty traits and the Disco tag which has provided ample opportunity to date. There's a drop of arena utility here, but really T-sizzle is your standard base/voyage tool who earns plenty of use despite an increasingly redundant skill set.
