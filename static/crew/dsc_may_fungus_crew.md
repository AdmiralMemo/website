Lacking the Gauntlet pair of the fluidic invader or the better base power of Ripper, May is the opposite of a fun-guy. If you're in it for bases, then she's a perfectly serviceable non-event shuttle pilot, with the second biggest gun of the Disco crew currently in game (behind her fore-water-bear Ripper), but she just lacks any kind of versatility. It's also worth noting that when this note was originally written, she was in the top ten SEC bases, company she was already struggling to keep - in the time since, she's been buried under multiple Picard crew, Diplomats, main cast crew and just so many more complete packages. And God help you if the Disco megas end - if that happens, she'll be leaning heavily on Mirror to leverage any kind of event utility, and lemme tell ya, that ain't where you want to hang your hat right now, one whole year after the last standalone Mirror weekend.
