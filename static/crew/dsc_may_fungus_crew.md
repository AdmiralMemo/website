Lacking the Gauntlet pair of the fluidic invader or the better base power of Ripper, May is the opposite of a fun-guy, and it's a really, really bad look when the nine base SEC options above you include three main series captains, two characters with a ton of traits that are snagging them a mega at the very moment of writing, and some really excellent voyage crew. If you're in it for bases, then she's a perfectly serviceable non-event shuttle pilot, with the second biggest gun of the Disco crew currently in game (behind her fore-water-bear Ripper), but she just lacks any kind of versatility. And God help you if the Disco megas end - if that happens, she'll be leaning heavily on Mirror to leverage any kind of event utility, and lemme tell ya, that ain't where you want to hang your hat right now, one whole year after the last standalone Mirror weekend.
