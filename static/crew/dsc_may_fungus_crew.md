“It’s gonna be May!” is an exasperated sigh from players who might find this Mirror Universe(?) mushroom entity hallucinated by Tilly in their Behold. 

May has parlayed her thin Trait set into four Collections to date and that’s pretty good considering how many crew with more Traits have a lot fewer. She’s got that extra-special Discovery hidden tag, which has given her a strong Event history and perhaps more Events in the future, especially since WRG resurrected the Discovery Mega Event in late 2022. Two skills, five Traits, four Collections… I guess we can say she’s not bad for what she is… which again is a hallucination made up of mushrooms.
