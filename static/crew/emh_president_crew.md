Once a political up and comer, President Doc has fallen out of favour with young and elderly voters alike. But fear not, he is still a man of connections and influence across all parties! With a spot in five Collections (four of which will boost stats), and a shot at two more should the lobbyists over at Big Trait grease the wheels at WRG, his long term value is as good as ever. Thereâ€™s even some niche Gauntlet use thanks to a 65% Crit chance, proving that this lame duck will not go down without a fight.
