Look past the smiling face and you will find a very powerful voyager lurking beneath that lumbering EV Suit. Sitting at the top of both the Shuttle and Voyage SCI/MED rankings, you can’t really go wrong picking Phlox as a pure workhorse in getting to the 8 hour voyage mark. Suitably to his attire, his work on shuttles is also guaranteed due to his very high SCI base which tops 1k with the right bonuses. He also boasts a good skill spread that is quite uncommon among Super Rare Crew. His traits however are quite lacking, which impacts his potential event participation because Phlox is not known to get frequent variant events. Whilst he won’t be a regular weekend feature, he certainly will pull his weight in voyages or daily shuttles.
