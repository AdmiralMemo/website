Look past the smiling face and you will find some impressive stats lurking beneath that cumbersome EV Suit. Sitting near the top of both the shuttle and voyage SCI/MED rankings, you canâ€™t really go wrong picking Phlox as a pure workhorse for zooming past the eight hour voyage mark. Suitable to his attire, Phlox's chance for shuttle work is better than his event count might intimate, thanks to a big 4-digit score with bonuses.

He also boasts a good skill spread that is very uncommon among Super Rare Crew, shared only by names who you've (rightfully) passed on many times in beholds. More of an early-game wonder, Phlox can at least offer two collection spots to cinch him in as a must-have for any roster.
