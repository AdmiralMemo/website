You don’t need our help telling you how much mileage to expect from a single skill common crew, but if you’re looking for a leveling project very light on faction items, Uhura can be that. As the only gray or green option to qualify for both of her stat-boosting collections, she’s a fine crew to immortalize once you have your cadet ducks in a row and may make a shuttle or two before hitting the cryo vault.
