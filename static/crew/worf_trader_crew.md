Somewhat fittingly, Trader Worf lacks any semblance of power. His Bases aren't daily use material, but do match up nicely with an impressive Worf/Klingon Event count that's well into double-digits. Aside from occasional Faction Event help, Trader offers a chunk of Attack and Crit Bonus at six seconds on Ships; fast enough to pair with most Instant Damage Ship Abilities.

With a pair of post-release Trait additions to pump up his Collection value too, thereâ€™s enough meat on the bone to justify a low-end Behold stab from time to time on your way to finishing the elusive Tribble Trouble Collection.
