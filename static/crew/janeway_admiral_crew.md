Repulsive bases and traits leave "Admiral Jane" with but one Life Line - the arena. One second evasion (with nice passives) is a future-proof option against another Polywater Yar scenario as players race for faster and faster ship battles and her ability lasts long enough to guard against all the big names. Then again, if you're a player who only does his five arena battles for the dailies, the Admiral leaves you with a voyage score so low that it can't be saved by her uncommon skill pair and bases no better than fourth among variants.
