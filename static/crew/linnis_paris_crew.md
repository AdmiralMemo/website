If Linnis Paris has popped up in your Legendary Behold, don’t even resist the urge to defenestrate your device while saying “Dammit, I’ve been Linnissed!”

Two skill MED options have it rough, rough, rough. MED is the Skill that shines on Voyages while being hamstrung by terrible Shuttle seating. In this case, Linnis hasn’t gotten to do very much of either.

New players could possibly utilize her in her 45% or 65% Gauntlets, but if you somehow end up with Linnis as the best option in a very bad Legendary Behold, you can at least hope one of her Traits might give her a weekend bonus in an Event that features MED or SCI bonus crew, or that she ends up at her maximum likely Collection ceiling of three.
