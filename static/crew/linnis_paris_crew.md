It's hard to find anything substantive to say about poor Crewman Linnis, but don't worry, that's never stopped me from rambling on for multiple paragraphs before! Linnis is something of a victim of Before and After Syndrome - the before being those years when MED crew were rare and you treasured even the smallest amount of it, and the after being right now, during the phenomenon we here at the Big Book have termed the MEDaissaince.

Even supposing your only MED crew were the mega legendaries Q as God and Soji Asha, it'd be hard for you to find meaningful work for Linnis, with a worse base than either, and no third skill, rendering her chances of being a worthwhile voyager about as non-existent as her chances of being on, well, Voyager. Her traits are, academically speaking, adequate - Romantic, Caregiver, Telepath, Physician could all see work in the future - but precisely none of them would be my first guess for really substantive event work. Realistically, she's going to end up useless on most rosters, all things told, and even if Physician ends up getting an extension a la Diplomat and Vulcan, she's still a bottom of the barrel pick.
