EV Suit's sunset scorecard is not unlike those of almost all of her other Legendary variants, Twilight’s Gauntlet ability notwithstanding. Meaning as a standalone crew, there’s not much here in the way of intrigue, but at least she’s a serviceable Event piece.

As one of the few ENT characters to get any love from WRG and in combination with Trait bonuses, T’Pol’s Shuttle-friendly Skills should have an easy time finding seats for Events in which she has a bonus. Some decent Collection value and an interesting Attack Boost Ship Ability offer other reasons for stacking some stars and make her a reliable if unexciting crew to try and extract long term value from.
