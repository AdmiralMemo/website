EV Suit's voyage power is in that certain area where you're looking for the right skill set to excuse some pedestrian ranks and CMD/SEC certainly isn't it. She can still be an asset, but is an eminently replaceable one.

As we look elsewhere, she profiles a bit better. Great bases (for a T'Pol), a smattering of variant and trait events, and dual collections - one of which (Vulcan) still requires golds to complete. Again, there's nothing here that can't be replicated, but she's still one of the better versions of her character.
