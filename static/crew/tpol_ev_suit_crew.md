“Hello? Yes this is the EV Suit Collection Hotline how may I help? Yes, well there is a bit of a queue now, can I take your number and call you back? Oh I’m sorry we don’t trade with the Xindi as it’s not part of our service contract. Why yes, we do take Romulan Express!”

Using a crewmember like T’Pol is a tricky thing to justify in this game. On one side her numbers are decent enough that should one want to indulge and attempt a run on the Vulcan collection then, fully fused, she might see some use. However those same stats are not strong enough that they can compete with the stronger mainstays such as Mirror Jean-Luc Picard or her more eventful counterpart EV Suit Burnham.

With a total of four traits, one of which has already had a mega event, her usability in future events and a lengthy trait based voyage is very limited. Add on to that a lacklustre ship ability and a crowded skillset you are likely to see her pushed to the bottom of a deep, inhospitable cite list. Good job she’s got that EV Suit!
