“Finally, a good Harry Kim!” exclaimed the three Kim enjoyers. Let us hit you over the head with the depicted length of pipe and tell you the tale of Prisoner Kim. 

Harry’s incredible Skill set and debut Voyage power catapulted him to an upper echelon Behold and Crew Retrieval choice right away, and even though Power Creep™ comes for them all, you’re probably looking at Voyage viability™ for another six months to a year. If you make the investment in his Immortalization now, your long term payoff will still be good; even when he does finally age out of your Voyages, he’ll have a solid Collection ceiling of four, and the Events that come with them, Kim variant Events notwithstanding.
