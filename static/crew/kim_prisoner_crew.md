When I first got here, I assumed the 6-pack was just a refined form of torture to make our prison stay that much more arduous. Gradually, I began to understand it more fully. It's all right here in my manifesto. My insights, my reasoning, my tiers. It's an experiment. They're studying us like animals. Pitting us against our wallets to find out what happens. You can see that, can't you?

Fittingly, Kim's 6-pack stayed true to its contents for many of us, exclaiming "This card is my friend. Nobody touches him!" But if you were lucky enough to win the bad-odds roulette, you were rewarded with a top flight Voyager attached to a name which picks up at least intermittent event work.

Base and gauntlet ranks which are disappointing at best for a new release somehow combine to form a top ten voyage score which Kim pairs with a totally unique skill order. His handful of ENG/MED even sits above coveted names like Indulgent Seven and The Caretaker for voyages.

There isn't much on the periphery (traits compliment his voyage work far more than any event chances), but this Kim will be in service for years on your voyages and will man the occasional Faction seat down the line.
