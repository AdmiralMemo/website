Let us collectively shout Teen Titans STOP on the game’s initial Rutherford offering. Debuting next to the recycling bin on Voyages and with a Primary Base rank which is as rank as the garbage can, this is clearly more of an affection pick.

The one area of interest here is a competent Trait lineup for Collections. Rutherford claims four Stat-Boosting spots out of the box, although further growth in that area would be unforeseen. Sadly, those Traits aren’t as beefy for a lacking Event history that will need a sprinkling of variant weekend bonuses to provide much value in the future.
