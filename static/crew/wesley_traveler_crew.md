Clearly something went wrong with the clocks in WRG, because apparently itâ€™s still 2017 according to Vestley's stats. Somehow he was still late to his own party, debuting after his warp theorist trait was featured in a mega event. Poor numbers compounding his obscure traits are a sure sign of his irrelevance. We are fast approaching the limit to Wesley variants (Polywater Wesley looms on nobody's mind) and with nothing but a poor entry in the SCI/ENG leagues, the only place he should "travel" is out your nearest airlock.
