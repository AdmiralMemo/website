After years of playing the long-suffering straight man, season seven badass Damar is here to chew bubblegum and kick ass and he's all out of ass. It's a shame seeing such a heroic on-screen character reduced to 'Budget Kahless', but seeing as the venerable clone is ahead of Damar in all of his Skill pairs, it's not necessarily a lie.

Thanks to the rotational nature of Gauntlet Trait sets and his three 45%ers, Damar is certainly worth using from time to time, even alongside other similar CMD Gauntleteers. When not rolling dice or downing Kanar, Damar's reasonable, if brief, Trait list promises at least a handful of future Events and some Collection growth, though his value there already puts him ahead of many other craptastic Legendaries.
