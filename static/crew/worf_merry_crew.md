Players forget Will Scarlett is a Worf variant because he doesn’t come up when you search for “Worf” in game. An oversight, surely. Long ago he would have made a Gauntlet or two with his beefy SEC/DIP Proficiencies, but this is no longer the case given the proliferation of many more crew who are “good at Gauntlet”.

Worf is a common Event name, and given he has two of the top three Skills for Shuttle seating, you’ll find yourself using him from time to time. Will’s true enduring value is his deceptively thin Trait list, which should max him out someday at five stat-Boosting Collections and his episode Vanity.
