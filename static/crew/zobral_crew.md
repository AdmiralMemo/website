Zo "Essence of the Male" bral is probably an anagram for 'bravado' in somebody's dictionary, but does his bite back up his bark? While he’s not longer best-in-class for Shipboard Instant Damage (looking at you, Chances Taken Kirk), he still has +10 Attack Boost at eight seconds, so he can be an integral part to your Skirmish or Arena lineup.

The rest of the card is window dressing. He’s no longer a Voyager (if he ever was) thanks to an onerous skill set. If MED/CMD/ENG is the Ferrari of Skill combos, CMD/DIP/SEC is like trying to merge onto the highway in a Hot Wheels. Even with better power, these sorts of crew are replaced so often, they may as well have "Made in Ferenginar" stamped on the back.

A pair of Braxton-esque 1-2 Proficiencies are again blunted by a Skill set far more competitive than CMD/ENG and in the absence of some applicable Traits like Desperate to grant him more 45% Crit sets, he has a hard-capped, new player ceiling. Zobral's prolific actor may have a following who'd be happy to employ him on their roster and his Shipboard bona fides can at least ensure that while we wait for an above-average Collection profile to turn more from potential into actual.
