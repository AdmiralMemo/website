Following more in his daughter's footsteps than his wife's for general utility (thank Kahless), Mike Burnham Sr. is definitely what you'd call a win for an event super rare. A smattering of eventable traits, a rare and eminently useable skill set, and a respectable SEC base make him the kind of purple who'll staff voyages for a good long while on earlier rosters.

Even older rosters may find the elusive SEC/SCI pairing useful if you haven't lucked into a Gary Seven or Dahj - and if you have, then he also makes an excellent bridge crew photo filler. Don't believe me? Stack him up next to Humbled Archer or Nella Daren, and see the comedic possibilities come to life.
