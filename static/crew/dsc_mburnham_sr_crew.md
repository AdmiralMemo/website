Among the crew that you say “who is that?” when he pops up on a Behold, not only because he’s a one-off character but because he is crouching, BurnDad has a few esoteric Traits to chase pie-in-the-sky Collections and Event bonuses, and a SEC Base that would fill Shuttle seats if those Events come to pass. A hypothetical Collection ceiling of four is his best attribute, so feel free to use him as Behold Insurance™ and Fuse him at your leisure.
