Solok, notedly not the Vulcan one who plays baseball and wrestles Captain Sisko, debuted to… what is the opposite of fanfare?... in late 2021 and hasn’t gotten any better. At this point, our darling DaiMon (did anyone else notice the title basically sounds like “demon”?) is little more than the sum of his Traits, which so far include two Collections and has three more viable options to give him a set of five if you can stomach taking him in Beholds.
