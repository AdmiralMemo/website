It's alright that Sisko's voyage power isn't there (anymore), his skill set isn't one that you need more of in that area of the game anyways. B.A. Sisko is more of an event piece with a useful arena ability attached. One Sisko is pretty much as good as the next for his events (unless you're wearing a tux) and with almost double digit traits, you can pencil him in for a few bonuses yearly.

His Skirmish and Arena nuke hits for the max amount among triggerless options and is a fine substitute if you're missing one of the top shelf options. Double collections are there if you need them, but are a blip on the radar for his overall value.
