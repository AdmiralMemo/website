You might find yourself saying, “Oh good, Benny Russell!” when this card pops up in a Legendary Behold but then you realize it’s the variant from 2017 and not the new Night Writing version from 2023.

Unfortunately this Sisko variant has little to offer the modern player except for a slot in the small Writer Collection, two additional Collections, and a deceptive Gauntlet pair. He will no longer Voyage, and his cousin Sisko variants include far better options for Events, even though somehow he’s still got the top Sisko SCI Base.
