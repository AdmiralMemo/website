Similar to his alter ego Chief O'Brien - let's call him Chief 2.0. He's not a Voyage or daily Shuttle option, but offers maybe the best Evasion Ship Ability that money can buy. Fast Initialization, long Duration, and heaps of Accuracy and Crit Bonus. And like most versions of the Chief, a few Collections and Events per year.
