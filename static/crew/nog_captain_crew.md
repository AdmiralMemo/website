We here at the Big Book have campaigned on the promise of a Ferengi Mega Event for years, but it’s been some time since we have had a racial Trait-based Mega Event. We haven’t lost hope though!

Barring that increasingly theoretical Mega Event, Nog is just about tapped out in terms of value growth. Both of his viable Traits are already Collections and it would take something like an Alternate Future Collection or Deep Space Nine show Collection for him to become any more desirable than he is, or isn’t, right now. Nog's a souped-up Super Rare at this stage, but at least offers more than several other decrepit Legendaries.
