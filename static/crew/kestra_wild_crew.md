"Wild Girl Of The Woods" shouts our favourite pizza wielding father figure to the huntress emerging from the forest. Brandishing the carcass of a future meal awaiting dissection, Kestra quickly becomes one of the newest favourite characters out of the fledgling new series.

Her appearance in the game matches her skills shown in Nepenthe. SEC for her ranging skills and a strong showing at that. DIP for her interactions with Soji and the combination is healthy enough to make a moderate showing in the upper ranges of those skill sets. However her lack of a third skill leaves her without much usability for voyage potential. Consider her a collection piece for a Picard event that might not come. Just don't let her dad burn the Bunnycorn!
