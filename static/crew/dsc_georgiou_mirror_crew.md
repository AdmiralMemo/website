Once eyed as a potential Event queen straddling Mirror and Discovery futures, Philippaâ€™s starry skies have materialized about as smoothly as a Vulcan science officer named Sonak. ðŸ’¥ With Georgiouâ€™s show now turning into a TV movie and blanket Discovery Mega Events likely at an end, sheâ€™s no longer quite the ace in the hole we thought she was - instead merely competent. 

As it stands, youâ€™re gambling on a pretty thin Trait pool and pure Georgiou star power to make her anything other than a Collection piece with few Traits viable for expansion, nay Conquest, in that area.
