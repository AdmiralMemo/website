Shuttle-quality bases meet passable voyage work for a limited number of skill combos, but her daily contributions pale in comparison to her weekend potential. As one of the more popular names from an ongoing TV show she may end up catching as many bonuses as anyone in STT history. Even without playing guessing games, the Empress has enjoyed an event bonus in two of every three months since her debut and pairs them excellently with double 1k bases. If you're a Discovery or Mirror fan, Emperor Philippa should be on your short list of crew to acquire.
