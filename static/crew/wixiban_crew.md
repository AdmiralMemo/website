“Can’t keep Wix down long!” Unless, of course, he *starts* down.

Wix’s debut numbers are just not acceptable. A voyage rank in the hundreds, base in the forties, no ancillary benefits such as gauntlet or arena punch. The game’s developer is daring you to do something productive with your weekend. For late game veterans just looking to stack stars on collection crew, Wix is at least average in terms of viable traits and his putrescence otherwise may give you an easier than usual shot at two or three copies from his event.
