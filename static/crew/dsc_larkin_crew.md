Don’t let his #1 base and voyage pair ranks fool you, he’s an idiot. Larkin is effectively a two skiller with that poor, but hilarious, DIP tertiary and will not cut it on most voyages. He’s one of the Super Rare MED/SCI crew I would avoid recommending to people purely for the fact that there are so many better alternatives. Agnes Jurati, Sarina Douglas and Nexus Guinan to name a few. No Arena, No Collection and his traits are underused but perhaps the Craft/’Shepherd Mega will come to fruition one day. Have him transferred to the freezer as soon as possible. This conversation is over, dismissed. This is the end of the conversation.
