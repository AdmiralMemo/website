The WinnebagoChair Deluxe with custom wood paneling has a tailpipe about this long...this thick. Unfortunately it has since broken down and is leaking oil all over the place, as his Voyage rankings have crashed and burned via Power Creepâ„¢.

With extremely limited Event chances due to no variants and only two viable Traits, both of which have already found Collections, Jameson is as about as decrepit as a card as he looks in his art.
