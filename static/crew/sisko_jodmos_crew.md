He's no dung beetle, in fact Klingon Sisko is pretty far from shit. Stout base and voyage numbers, a very steady event pace, and double collections make him an ideal crew to offset a worn out skill set. With the expansion of his Diplomat collection, "top super rare variant base" and gorgeous traits are attributes that put him near the head of the line for you to acquire and level as you chip away at collecting all of the available stat bonuses.
