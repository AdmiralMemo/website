Having cut his teeth in the Gauntlet since his 2017 debut, Gorignak has been somewhat rudely excused from there, first by the Mega Event Recurring Legendary Surak and again later by Gauntlet Exclusive Armus. His top five SCI/CMD pair is still a boon to newer players, but he's as likely to face 40% win chance walls as any other Crew. 

Pick up Yarnek from sub-par Beholds if you have to and hope it pays off with up to three realistic Collections, plus three longshots.
