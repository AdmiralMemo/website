The delightfully scheming Vadic is only missing a moustache to twirl as she makes her way from the Shrike and into your Event rewards table. If you thought she deserved a Legendary variation well, scroll up (or down…or search her name) and you’ll find that WRG saw fit to give Amanda Plummer her due all at once!

While she may only be a Super Rare, at least she’s not quite DOA. Easy to acquire for most players given the nature of her Event (Skirmish in the first half), a younger account can do a lot worse that snagging a Super Rare with a respectable Pri/Sec punch that will be perfect for Shuttles until such time as you get your hands on better Legendaries. Those same accounts (along with those wacky Nightmare Mode™ ones) will be happy to see her get use on some Voyages as well, should they still have holes to plug there. For everyone else, well she’s a pretty standard crew to freeze and forget, with only one Collection to her name and an outside chance at a few more.
