So, let's start with the most interesting thing about Ambassador V'Lar - namely, the fact that she was played by an Irish actress with the absolutely incomparable name of Fionnula Flanagan. Just take a look at that name, ladies and gents. Damn. Fionnula.

Unfortunately, that, and the fact that the same actress played Juliana Tainer (Data's mum!!!), are where the interesting points about this card come to an abrupt end, because she really is just +1 Diplomat, +1 Vulcan, fringe use in the Arena if you feel like flexing that you experiment with more than one ship layout. 

Those collections are easily the most desirable in the game, to be sure, but with a card this limited in use, the cost of renting that progress seems just too high. The simple fact of the matter is, investing in six packs like this is the true Kobayashi Maru; all you're ultimately doing is getting a momentary boost until the next 4* Diplomat/Vulcan comes along to make your spent Dil feel like a waste, and we have it on good authority that October's mega will yield cards with much better long term prospects than T'Pol's fallen hero. Don't fall for her charm and grace, good readers - you'll only end up wishing you shot her into space.
