His gumbo sure is smellin' good, but it's the rest of this card that stinks. Poor Grandpa Joe doesn't collect Event appearances from his son or grandson and he has withered Bases. Even a respectable DIP Proficiency gets stomped by the likes of The Red Angel and Locutus in his 45% Crit sets. 

That being said, there's a theoretical five or six Collection ceiling here and if his above average Trait list heats up, don't wait for this note to refresh to grab his multiple Collections if your other Behold options are especially poor.
