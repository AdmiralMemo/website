Security Hoss Molly O'Brien. Oh, hell yes. A Mugato-esque Trait lineup grants Molly three Collection spots and the possibility of event thawpertunities when you least expect them. Her competent SEC base (best kept in cryo) will provide almost all of her actual use on your roster thanks to mostly poor Voyage, Gauntlet, and Arena metrics.  In the long term, you need to snag your four copies to finish the AWFUL Primal Collection (so many bad bad Legendaries) and she may reward you with up to one more Collection as a thank you.
