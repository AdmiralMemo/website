Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.

No, not the movie, the Borg Queen!

I wish there was a fancy, hard to spell or pronounce word that could be used to shorten that, but until that day, we’ll just continue to use EEAAOBQ. We’ve been kicking that one around the office for a few months, I think it will stick.

You know what else will stick? A new Legendary that is a Voyage powerhouse, viable Ship and FBB abilities, a constant Shuttle seat occupier, and a handful of Collections. If that package sounds up your alley, then run (don’t walk!) to your nearest Continuum Mission and get a copy!

The likely final version of The Borg Queen we will see in Trek was a fitting threat and overall metaphor for Picard Season 3. She has always been present in the galaxy, she has always been a part of Jean-Luc just as he was a part of her, and she loves her family.

TPG did this card right by giving her fitting stats and art, even if it is another CMD variant. Debuting as the number two Voyager in the game by raw power and the top of the Skill Triplet, her majesty will find use in any players roster for years, likely not to give her throne away for a very long time. Her giant CMD base will ride any shuttle – event or daily variant. Greeting you with a warm hug of three Collections, I’d wager you’ll see three or four more before the game meets an eventual end from a well-placed photon torpedo. Her ship ability, which is a 15000 Crit Bonus with a +10 ATK rivals other such powerhouse FBB mainstays like Demo Man Scotty or her ‘son’, Vox.

The only way currently to earn a copy is to complete all three difficulty levels of the current Continuum Mission set – a new ‘final prize’ being tested by TPG and repeating for four total weeks, much like a Mega Event. The price of admission to those missions is immortalized Legendary cards (or the best of the Super Rares for you Nightmare Mode Enjoyers) – so if you haven’t unlocked Quipment slots on your 6 best skilled Golds, time is short – after the four weeks is up, you’ll have to wait for the portal update a year later.

…..UBIQUITIOUS! That’s the word I was looking for. Thank god for spell check.
