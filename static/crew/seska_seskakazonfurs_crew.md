I just want to say - still salty about removing her Bajoran Trait days before its first Event bonus. Dick move, man.

Traits are indeed the name of the game for Seska who, despite an ENG-led Skill set, has zero functionality for normal day to day operations. With Kazon and Obsidian Order Traits not likely to bear fruit for Collections or Events, sheâ€™s more or less hanging on to three Traits for value, but has a valid chance to hit her Collection ceiling before too long.
