Version 2.0 is a completely redesigned user experience.

**&rarr; [Click Here to go to the new DataCore v2.0 website, now!](https://beta.datacore.app) &larr;**

Version 2.0 is a complete redesign of the entire application, grouping like tooling together and creating an integrated experience
with or without user data. New features to take advantage of changes to Star Trek Timelines have also been written, including for Quipment, and Continuum missions, and will continue to be improved upon in upcoming service releases.

After v2.0 is pushed to production, the main website will reflect the changes you will find in v2.0 beta site. The old site may still be offered as an alternative for a limited amount of time, in case there is an unanticipated major issue with the deployment. However, we expect to discontinue servicing that site after a reasonable amount of time.

We encourage everyone to try the new site, now, so that you can become accustomed to the new layout.
