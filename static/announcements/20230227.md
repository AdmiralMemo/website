The [Voyage Calculator](/playertools?tool=voyage) has been updated with a few new features, QOL changes, and a bug fix or two.<!-- end -->

Some of the more notable additions to the Voyage Calculator player tool include:

#### Multiple Layouts
You can now toggle the layout of lineup recommendations, allowing you to choose between compactness or a more visual appearance. Four different layouts are currently available. Your preference will be remembered by your device.

#### Better Comparisons and Dismiss Option
Whenever a new recommendation is produced, the calculator will compare the recommendation's estimate to the estimates of all other open recommendations. You can now also dismiss a recommendation by clicking the ðŸš« button. Combined, these options should make it easier to narrow down the recommendations that you'd like to consider.

#### Confident Estimates
Click the âŒ› button to get a more confident estimate for any given recommendation. This is particularly useful when looking for a more accurate minimum runtime or moonshot, which can be trickier to predict.

As always, feedback is welcome! If you run into any problems or have suggestions for a different layout, let us know in the [DataCore Discord](https://discord.gg/2SY8W7Aeme).
