## What's New?

### Crew Retrieval updates

The crew retrieval tool has been redesigned to better help users identify potentially useful polestars for retrieving crew, in addition to the classic way of showing which crew can be retrieved with currently owned polestars. Use the new dropdown to switch between the new features ("Show all uniquely retrievable crew") and classic crew retrieval ("Only show crew I can retrieve").

The View Options button in the final column now opens in a modal, which allows for additional features, such as a toggle for hiding combos with unowned polestars and suggestions for acquiring needed polestars from owned constellations.

Polestars use color-coding to help visualize certain situations:
* Yellow = needed polestars
* Orange = filtered polestars
* Blue = added prospective polestars

Users can now add crew to a retrieval wishlist (by tapping the heart icon on a crew's combos modal), for help in planning. The owned dropdown includes a filter for showing crew in your wishlist.

Adds gauntlet ranks and quipment grades to the main table.

Collection counts now ignore maxed-out collections. Tapping any collection cell now expands to a more readable table, detailing collection progress for that crew.

### Shuttle Helper updates

The shuttle helper tool has received a number of quality of life updates, including the ability to work with daily shuttles, not just event shuttles. You can access the shutle helper directly now from the tools menu.

Running missions and assignments are now imported with player data and can be used as baseline recommendations. A status column has been added to the missions table, which identifies non-open, open (with expiration times), running, and manually-created missions.

The event projection now has options to project multiple scoring scenarios by scheduling shuttles of various durations and regularity. The projection also shows the number of rental tokens and time boosts, when needed.

### Fleet Boss Battles updates

The Fleet Boss Battles tool has a new option that enables confirmation of solved traits before clearing the node from the UI. This option allows spotters to continue processing nodes when the solution can be deduced manually, while waiting for a fleetmate to actually clear the node in-game. In groups view and the export, the list of crew who can clear that node will continue to be listed until the node is confirmed. The spotter can confirm the solved traits by clicking on the traits or any crew.

Solving nodes by marking crew and solving traits via the traits view behave as usual, bypassing the need for confirmation.

Spot solves are now marked with a green checkmark circle. "Infallible" solves (i.e. solves authenticated by player data) are now marked with a white checkmark.

### Unneeded Items updates

The unneeded items tool now consolidates equipment suggestions to a single section, with new options to filter items by efficiency (i.e. low number owned), single-use equipment (i.e. equipment that's only used by a single crew in the game), and unowned crew. Check all to list the safest equipment to discard.

The equipment calculation has also been revised to account for potential usefulness of equipment on unowned crew.
